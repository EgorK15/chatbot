Starvest’s strategy\\nto steer its portfolio toward precious metal investments in recent years has enabled the Company to position itself\\nattractively for the current environment. Although improved investor sentiment boosted certain precious metal\\nstocks and those of certain other natural resource companies, gold prices declined 5.5% for the year ended 30\\nSeptember 2022. The post-pandemic global economy and interest rate hikes, particularly in the US, have kept\\nprices flat recently but we continue to believe that there is a solid foundation for precious metals going forward.\\nOur investment portfolio decreased approximately 56% in the year to 30 September 2022 to £6 million. However,\\nthe discount to net asset value narrowed by 5 percentage points, from 34% to 29% as at 30 September 2022,\\nwhich is a significant improvement for shareholders.\\nGreatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in\\nAustralia. Havieron’s initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent* to 6.5M oz gold equivalent\\nduring the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered\\noperational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not\\nuncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.\\nAriana Resources continues to expand its exploration and development footprint in Europe. As the Kiziltepe mine\\nhas continued to meet production expectations, Ariana has focused on other projects in Turkey, such as Tavsan,\\nwhich is scheduled for first production in H2 2023. The alliance with Newmont, via its West Tethyan holding, allows\\nconsiderable scope to explore southeastern Europe over the next five years, and the recently acquired Kosovo\\nlicence shows an interesting start to this US$2.5m agreement. Together with the Asgard Metals Fund, Ariana’s\\nexploration and development projects have expanded considerably since the company’s founding twenty years\\nago.\\nCora Gold continued to de-risk its Sanankoro project as it completed further drilling and increased its mineral\\nresource estimate by 14% while completing a feasibility study. After year-end the company announced that it had\\nreceived the Environmental Permit required for the project, a significant step forward.\\nWe believe that the long-term outlook for gold prices remains favourable and we remain committed to our\\nstrategy.\\n* GGP RNS dated 10 December 2020       GGP RNS dated 3 March 2022\\nInvesting policy\\nThe Company’s investing policy is set forth on page 3 of this report and made available on our website,\\nwww.starvest.co.uk.\\nTrading portfolio valuation\\nA brief review of the major portfolio companies follows from page 6. Other investee companies are listed on the\\nwebsites from which further information may be obtained.\\nShareholder information\\nThe Company’s shares are traded on AIM.\\nAnnouncements  made  to  the  London  Stock  Exchange  are  available  from  the  Company’s  website,\\nwww.starvest.co.uk, where historical reports and announcements are also available.\\nCallum N Baxter\\nChairman\\n07 February 2023\\n2\\n', '\\n\\nInvesting policy statement:\\nAbout us\\nThe previous Board commenced to manage the Company as an investment company in January 2002, largely\\ninvesting in the natural resources sector. Following the appointment of Callum Baxter as Chairman in 2015, the\\nBoard continued to focus the Company’s investment strategy on the natural resources sector.\\nCollectively, the current Board has significant experience investing in small-capitalisation new issues and pre-IPO\\nopportunities in the natural resources and mineral exploration sectors.\\nCompany objective\\nThe Company was established as a source of early-stage finance to fledgling businesses to maximise the capital\\nvalue of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest\\ndividends.\\nInvesting strategy\\nNatural resources:  Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the\\nBoard sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were\\ngenerally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the\\nnature of the public equity markets has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio\\nwill include companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the\\nappropriate financial backing, developing a commercial resource.\\nDirect Projects: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target\\ncompanies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects\\nand subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct\\nproject interests. Those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be\\noperated by the investee company; Starvest does not intend to manage any projects. The addition of the Direct\\nProject strategy to the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual\\ngeneral meeting held 1 December 2017.\\nInvestment size:  Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies invariably have an\\nongoing need for additional funding to continue exploration and development. Therefore, after appropriate due\\ndiligence, the Company may provide further funding support and make later market purchases, so that the total\\ninvestment may exceed £100,000.\\nHigh risk:  The business is inherently high risk and cyclical, dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity\\nwhich affects the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the opportunity to participate in\\ndiverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for significant returns for the\\nforeseeable future.\\nLack of liquidity:  Shares of investee companies typically trade in small volumes, even if they are quoted on AIM,\\nAQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, during the early phase following an investment, it is rarely possible to liquidate\\na position at the quoted market price so investors must remain patient until the investee company develops and\\nultimately attracts greater market interest. If and when an exploration company finds a large exploitable resource,\\nit typically presents greater liquidity to patient investors as an acquisition target by a third party or as a much larger\\nand more actively traded independent entity.\\nSuccess rate:  Of the multiple investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove\\nto be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, we\\nexpect that over time portfolio returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is unable to give\\nany estimate of the magnitude or timing of returns.\\nProfit distribution:  When profits have been realised, and adequate cash is available, the Board intends to\\ndistribute up to half the profits realised.\\n3\\n', '\\nInvesting policy statement, continued\\nInvesting strategy, continued\\nOther matters:  The Company currently has an investment in Equity Resources Limited, which itself is an\\ninvestment company.\\nThe Company takes no part in the active management of investee companies, although directors of the Company\\nhave served as directors on the boards of such companies.\\n4\\n', '\\n\\nReview of trading portfolio:\\nIntroduction\\nDuring the year to 30 September 2022, the portfolio comprised interests in the companies discussed below, as\\nwell as other active companies that are not discussed herein.\\nThe economic shock of the global pandemic continued throughout 2022 and investors’ desire for traditional safe-\\nhaven assets boosted precious metals stocks at times. However, supply chain issues and European conflict led\\nto rising energy prices, broader-based inflation and a shift in economic policies which caused market reactions\\nand precious metal price fluctuations as well as an overall decline year on year in metal prices when forecasts for\\ngrowth were downgraded. In this environment, we believe our strategy to focus on investments in gold producers\\nwill prove to be rewarding on a risk-adjusted basis for our shareholders. However, during the year to 30 September\\n2022, the value of our trading portfolio decreased ~56% due to lower market prices for major positions. Including\\nour cash position, our net asset value (“NAV”) and NAV per share decreased 53.4% and 53.7%, respectively, over\\nthe 12-month period to 30 September 2022. Given that Starvest’s market capitalisation decreased approximately\\n49%, the discount to NAV narrowed to 29% compared to 34% a year ago.\\nTransactions\\nDuring the year the Company did not raise capital through placing or subscription.\\nThe Company disposed of its full holdings in Minera IRL during the year, along with a small portion of its positions\\nin Greatland Gold (3.8m shares at an average price of 12.83p per share) and Ariana Resources (2.2m shares at\\nan average price of 4.25p per share).\\nTrading portfolio valuation\\nAlthough gold prices declined slightly (~5%) year on year, this change masked greater volatility during the 12-\\nmonth period.

The increased estimate was ratified in August 2022 when Newcrest released its\\nown resource upgrade. Neither resource takes into account drilling carried out after February 2022, which could\\nyield a significant increase in resource if included. Drilling to date has not yet closed off the deposit, with Havieron\\nremaining open at depth and in multiple directions, allowing for significant resource growth in the future.\\nIn addition, Greatland took several corporate and financial actions this year. Newcrest boosted its stake in\\nHavieron to 70% but declined to exercise an option to acquire an additional 5% of the project.

Under that law the\\nDirectors have elected to prepare financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted\\nAccounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the\\nDirectors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of\\nthe state of affairs and profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the\\nDirectors are required to:\\n-  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;\\n-  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;\\n-  state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures\\ndisclosed and explained in the financial statements;\\n-  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the\\ncompany will continue in business.\\nThe Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the\\ncompany’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company\\nand enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also\\nresponsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention\\nand detection of fraud and other irregularities.\\nThe Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included\\non the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of\\nfinancial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.\\nThe Company is compliant with AIM Rule 26 regarding the Company’s website.\\n18\\n\", '\\n\\nCorporate governance statement:\\nThe Board of Starvest plc are committed to the principles of good corporate governance and believe in the\\nimportance  and  value  of  robust  corporate  governance  and  in  our  accountability  to  our  shareholders  and\\nstakeholders.\\nThe AIM Rules for companies, updated in early 2018, required AIM companies to apply a recognised corporate\\ngovernance code from 28 September 2018. Starvest has chosen to adhere to the Quoted Company Alliance’s\\nCorporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies (the “QCA Code”) and listed below are\\nthe 10 broad principles of the QCA Code and the Company’s disclosure with respect to each point.\\nThe Board recognises the importance of good governance, agrees to the principals set out in the QCA Code, and\\nis compliant with the vast majority of the QCA Code. However, the Company does not achieve full compliance\\nwith the QCA Code; specifically, Principles 5 and 7. The areas of non-compliance will be readily addressed as the\\nCompany grows and additional members are added to the Board.\\nThe Board recognises that it is non-compliant with Principle 5 where the QCA Code recommends that at least two\\ndirectors are independent. The QCA Code requires that the boards of AIM companies have an appropriate balance\\nbetween executive and non-executive directors. The Board believes, at this time in the Company’s development\\nand with respect to the Company’s size and goals of achieving good shareholder value through preserving cash\\nfor investment opportunities, that the positions within the Board are sufficient to carry out good corporate\\ngovernance with a balanced approach to decisions. As the Company grows this matter will be reviewed and\\naddressed with the goal of appointing additional board members and filling a non-executive, independent role.\\nThe Board recognises that it does not fully comply with Principle 7 in that Starvest currently does not have formal\\nevaluation procedures for individual board members but the Board recognises that a formal evaluation process\\nmay become necessary in the near future.\\nQCA CODE:\\n1: Establish a strategy and business model promoting long-term value for shareholders:\\nThe Company is established as a source of early stage finance to fledgling businesses, to maximise the\\ncapital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and\\nmodest dividends.\\nInvesting strategy\\nNatural resources: Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the\\nBoard sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were\\ngenerally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the\\nnature of the market has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio will include\\ncompanies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the appropriate\\nfinancial backing, developing a commercial resource.\\nDirect Project: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target\\ncompanies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects\\nand subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct\\nproject interests; those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be\\noperated by the investee company; Starvest will not manage any project. Prior to selling any projects to corporate\\nentities, Starvest may therefore have an interest in a number of projects. The addition of the Direct Project strategy\\nto the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting held\\n1 December 2017.\\nInvestment size: Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies are invariably not\\ngenerating cash, but rather they have a constant need for additional funding in order to continue exploration and\\ndevelopment. Therefore, after appropriate due diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and\\nmake later market purchases, so that the total investment may be greater than £100,000.\\n19\\n', '\\nCorporate governance statement, continued\\nHigh risk: The business is inherently high risk and cyclical in nature dependent upon fluctuations in world\\neconomic activity which impacts on the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the\\nopportunity to participate in diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for\\nsignificant returns for the foreseeable future.\\nLack of liquidity: The investee companies, being small, almost invariably lack share market liquidity, even if they\\nare quoted on AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, in the early years it is rarely possible to sell an investment\\nat the quoted market price with the result that extreme patience is required whilst the investee company develops\\nand ultimately attracts market interest. If and when an explorer finds a large exploitable resource, it may become\\nthe object of a third party bid, or otherwise become a much larger entity; either way an opportunity to realise cash\\nis expected to follow.\\nSuccess rate: Of the 15 to 20 investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove\\nto be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, the\\nexpectation is that in time Shareholder returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is\\nunable to give any estimate of the quantum or timing of returns.\\nProfit distribution: When profits have been realised and adequate cash is available, it is the intention of the\\nBoard to recommend the distribution of up to half the profits realised.\\nOther matters: The Company currently has investments in the following companies, which themselves are\\ninvestment companies: Equity Investors plc and Equity Resources Limited. The Company takes no part in the\\nactive management of the companies in which it invests,\\n2: Seek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations\\nThe Board recognises that it is accountable to Shareholders for the performance and activities of the Company\\nand to this end is committed to providing effective communication with the Shareholders of the Company.\\nUnpublished price sensitive information is disclosed in as timely a manner as possible and in accordance with\\nregulatory requirements for disclosure via a Regulatory Information Service provider.\\nSignificant developments of investee companies are disseminated through stock exchange announcements and\\nby regularly updating the Company’s website, where descriptions of the investee company projects are available\\nand updated quarterly or whenever there is a significant event. In addition, copies of any research notes are\\navailable.\\nThe Board views the Annual General Meeting as an important forum for communication between the Company\\nand its Shareholders and encourages Shareholders to express their views on the Company’s business activities\\nand performance. Previous shareholder engagements at AGMs and other functions have been productive with\\nmany questions answered by the Board. During other times of the year shareholder contact is primary through the\\nexecutive directors at investor events and via the company’s email: info@starvest.co.uk. Shareholder comments\\nor issues are disseminated to the Board and taken into account when reviewing the performance and development\\nof the Company.\\nThe Board, through the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Director and the Non-executive Chairman, also\\nmaintains regular contact with its advisors in order to ensure that the Board develops an understanding of the\\nviews of major Shareholders about the Company. The main point of shareholder contact is the CEO, Mr Mark\\nBadros,  and  the  other  Executive  Director,  Ms  Gemma  Cryan,  who  are  contactable  via  email  at\\ninfo@starvest.co.uk, by telephone +44 (0)2077 696 876, or in writing to the following address; Starvest plc, 33\\nSt.James’s Square,  London UK,  SW1Y 4JS\\n20\\n', '\\nCorporate governance statement, continued\\n3: Take into account wider stakeholder and social responsibilities and their implications for long-term\\nsuccess.\\nThe Board recognises that the success of the Company is reliant on the stakeholders of the business and, to this\\neffect, the Company engages with these stakeholder groups, both internal and external on a regular basis.\\nThe Company’s strategy to investment immediately prior to an initial public offering, on AIM or AQSE dictates that\\nwe foster good relationships with broking firms, other professional service providers to the natural resource\\nindustry and members of mining and exploration companies in order to keep abreast of potential investment\\nopportunities.\\nThe Company engages with numerous established broking firms and a network of professionals within the natural\\nresource industry to keep abreast of new companies and investment opportunities becoming available. The\\ncompany deals only with ethically sound entities and, as such, reduces any risk to investment capital by unethical\\nbusiness practices.\\nInvestee companies and potential investee companies are reviewed with respect to country and community\\ncommitments to social and environmental responsibility. It is the company’s belief that a good CSR (corporate\\nsocial responsibility) policy enhances an investee company’s standing and thus progress of a project/resource on\\na local, regional and government scale.\\nInvestment by the Company in resource projects generally brings positive benefits to local communities who gain\\nfrom employment, improved infrastructure and access to health facilities.\\n4:  Embed  effective  risk  management,  considering  both  opportunities  and  threats  throughout  the\\norganisation\\nThe business is inherently high risk and of a cyclical nature dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity\\nwhich impacts on the demand for minerals. However, it offers the investor a spread of investments in an exciting\\nsector, which the Board believes will continue to offer the potential of significant returns for the foreseeable future.\\nThrough the Board’s collective industry experience and thorough research and investigation into potential\\ninvestments, including but not limited to: geological setting, board and management experience, financial plans,\\njurisdictional risk and market conditions both current and forecast; we strive to minimise the inherent risks yet still\\navail of opportunities that will deliver good returns on investment capital in the medium to long term. The Company\\nmaintains an Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee with each reporting directly to the Board. Each\\nCommittee comprises one Executive Director and one Non-Executive Director.\\nThe Company maintains a risk register that identifies key risks in the areas of corporate strategy, and finances as\\nwell as a comprehensive register for assessing investment opportunities. The register is reviewed periodically and\\nupdated as and when necessary. If there are any significant changes to the trading environment then the register\\nis reviewed and updated as required.\\nWithin the scope of the annual audit, specific financial risks are evaluated in detail, including in relation to foreign\\ncurrency, liquidity and credit.\\n5: Maintain the board as a well-functioning, balanced team led by the chair\\nInformation on the company board members is available on the following website page as well as in the company’s\\nannual reports and accounts disclosures.\\nhttp://www.starvest.co.uk/board/\\nBoard of Directors\\nThe Board of Directors currently comprises three Directors, two of whom are Executive Directors.\\n21\\n', '\\nCorporate governance statement, continued\\nEach member of the board is committed to spending sufficient time to enable them to carry out their duties;\\nExecutive  Directors  commit  a  minimum  of  twenty  hours  per  week,  with  periods  where  this  is  increased\\nconsiderably, such as mid-term and end of year reporting periods as well as times when investment transactions\\nare being undertaken.

The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law\\nand United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in\\nthe UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).\\nIn our opinion, the financial statements:\\n-  give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 September 2022 and of its loss for\\nthe year then ended;\\n-  have been properly prepared in accordance with United  Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting\\nPractice; and\\n-  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.\\nBasis for opinion\\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable\\nlaw. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit\\nof the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical\\nrequirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical\\nStandard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with\\nthese requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide\\na basis for our opinion.\\nConclusions relating to going concern\\nIn auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Director's use of the going concern basis of\\naccounting  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  is  appropriate.  Our  evaluation  of  the  Directors’\\nassessment of the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included a review\\nof the cash flow forecasts prepared by management, challenging the assumptions made therein and evaluating\\nthe ability of the company to realise its Level 1 investments, if required, to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or\\nconditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a\\ngoing concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the\\nrelevant sections of this report.\\nOur application of materiality\\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. The quantitative and qualitative thresholds\\nfor materiality determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.\\nMateriality for the company financial statements was set at £184,000 (2021: £422,000). This was calculated based\\non 3% of net assets, of which equity investments comprise the majority of the balance. The basis for calculating\\nmateriality is unchanged from the previous year, with the reduction reflecting the fall in fair value of equity\\ninvestments at year-end. The benchmark used is the one which we determined, in our professional judgment, to\\nbe the key benchmark within the financial statements relevant to shareholders of an investment management\\ncompany in assessing financial performance. The key driver of the company and assessment of its performance\\nis linked to the valuation of its equity investments held. Performance materiality has been set at £128,800 (2021:\\n£295,400) being 70% of headline materiality, based upon our assessment of risk and the absence of any audit\\nadjustments in previous periods.\\nWe agreed to report to those charged with governance all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified\\nthrough our audit with a value in excess of £9,000 (2021: £21,100). We also agreed to report any other audit\\nmisstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\\n30\\n\", '\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued\\nOur approach to the audit\\nIn designing our audit, we determined materiality, and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial\\nstatements. In particular, we looked at areas where the Directors made significant judgements, comprising the fair\\nvalue of investments at level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We also assessed the risk of management override\\nof internal controls.\\nKey audit matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of\\nthe financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material\\nmisstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the\\noverall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming\\nour opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\nKey Audit Matter: How our scope addressed this matter\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Note 10): The Company holds equity investments with a carrying value of £6m (2021: £14m) as at 30 September 2022. The portfolio consists largely of listed investments, and thus are valued under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Unlisted investments are subject to management valuation, and thus are exposed to significant levels of management judgement and estimation. These investments have been written down to £Nil in previous periods. Based upon the significance of the value of the investments held at the year end, this was determined to be a Key Audit Matter.\\nOur work in this area included:\\n- Reviewing the valuation methodology for each type of investment held and ensuring the carrying values are supported by sufficient and appropriate audit evidence;\\n- Ensuring that investments are categorised and disclosed correctly in accordance with UK GAAP;\\n- Agreeing year-end fair values to independent sources of price data;\\n- Ensuring that the company has legal title to the investments held; and\\n- Performing tests of detail on investment disposals in the year.\\nOther information\\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements\\nand our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the\\nannual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the\\nextent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our\\nresponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially\\ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise\\nappears  to  be  materially  misstated.  If  we  identify  such  material  inconsistencies  or  apparent  material\\nmisstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial\\nstatements themselves. If, based  on the work we  have performed, we conclude that there  is a material\\nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\\n31\\n', '\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued\\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\\n-  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the\\nfinancial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\\n-  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal\\nrequirements.\\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the\\naudit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.\\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires\\nus to report to you if, in our opinion:\\n-  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received\\nfrom branches not visited by us; or\\n-  the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\\n-  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or\\n-  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\\nResponsibilities of directors\\nAs explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the\\npreparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such\\ninternal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are\\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue\\nas a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis\\nof accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic\\nalternative but to do so.\\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free\\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance\\nwith ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or\\nerror and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to\\ninfluence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.\\nIrregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures\\nin line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,\\nincluding fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is\\ndetailed below:\\n-  We obtained an understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates to identify laws and\\nregulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We\\nobtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management and application of cu-\\nmulative audit knowledge.\\n32\\n', \"\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued\\n-  We determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the company in this regard to be those arising\\nfrom:\\n-  Companies Act 2006\\n-  FRS 102\\n-  AIM Rules\\n-  We designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indica-\\ntions of non-compliance by the company with those laws and regulations. These procedures included, but\\nwere not limited to:\\n-  Enquiries of management\\n-  Review of board minutes and other correspondence\\n-  Review of the company’s related party transactions and disclosures\\n-  We also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We consid-\\nered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of\\ncontrols, that the existence and good title to investments represented the greatest risk of fraud.\\n-  We addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit proce-\\ndures which included, but were not limited to: the testing of journals and evaluating the business rationale\\nof any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.\\nBecause of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including\\nthose leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation.  This risk\\nincreases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected\\nin the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is\\nalso greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional\\nconcealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.\\nA further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial\\nReporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s\\nreport.\\nUse of our report\\nThis report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the\\nCompanies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members\\nthose matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.

Company Information\\nStarvest plc is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England & Wales. The registered office is Salisbury\\nHouse, London Wall, London, EC2M 5PS. The Company\\'s shares are listed on the AIM market of the London\\nStock Exchange. These Financial Statements (the \"Financial Statements\") have been prepared and approved by\\nthe Directors on 07 February 2023 and signed on their behalf by Mark Badros and Gemma Cryan.\\n2.  Basis of Preparation\\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting\\nstandards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 – ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the\\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS102’), and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements\\nhave been prepared on the historical cost basis. There are no fair value adjustments other than to the carrying\\nvalue of the Company’s trade investments. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is\\nalso the functional currency of the company.\\nGoing concern\\nThe Company\\'s day to day financing is from its available cash resources and, on occasion, by the part disposal of\\ninvestments and use of short-term loans.\\nThe Directors are confident that adequate funding can be raised as required to meet the Company\\'s current and\\nfuture liabilities, which has been confirmed within the cash flow forecast prepared by the Board for the 12 months\\nending 29 February 2024. In the unlikely event that such finance could not be raised, the Directors could raise\\nsufficient funds by disposal of certain of its current asset trade investments.\\nAs at the date of this report, the Company has no borrowings.\\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Directors are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its current and\\nfuture liabilities, and continue trading, for the foreseeable future and, in any event, for a period of not less than\\ntwelve months from the date of approving the financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements on\\na going concern basis is therefore considered to remain appropriate.\\n3.  Principal Accounting Policies\\nAdministrative expenses\\nAll administrative expenses are stated inclusive of VAT, where applicable, as the company is not eligible to reclaim\\nVAT incurred on its costs.\\nTaxation\\nCorporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rates enacted or substantially enacted at the\\nbalance sheet date.\\nUnder FRS102, investments are valued on a mark-to-market basis using publicly quoted trading prices at year\\nend irrespective of whether they are classified as fixed or current assets.\\u202f However, pursuant to Part 3, Chapter 3,\\nCorporation Tax Act 2009, any increase in the value of a current asset is recognised as a trading profit and\\nimmediately subject to Corporation Tax when a company is classified as a trading company under HMRC rules\\nand regulations, whereas an increase in the value of a fixed asset is not subject to taxation until the asset is\\ndisposed  of when  a  company  is classified  as an  investment  company.

Principal Accounting Policies, continued\\nTaxation, continued\\nHistorically, the Company’s previous board had filed as a trading company and described its investment portfolio\\nas  a  current  asset. Following  a  comprehensive  review  of various  factors  related  to  the  Company’s\\ninvestment portfolio and strategy, including, among others, the frequency, timing, liquidity, trading activities,\\ndevelopment stage and investment horizon of such investments individually and the portfolio as a whole, the\\nCompany’s  current  board  have  determined  the  Company  is  appropriately  classified as  an  investment\\ncompany, and the investment portfolio is properly accounted for among the Company’s fixed assets. The Board\\ndo not consider this to be a change in accounting policy; rather, it is a correction in presentation to reflect more\\naccurately the factual position.\\nDeferred tax\\nDeferred tax is provided on an undiscounted full provision basis on all timing differences which have arisen but\\nnot reversed at the balance sheet date using rates of tax enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet\\ndate.\\nDeferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the\\nreversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits and are recognised within debtors. The deferred\\ntax assets and liabilities all relate to the same legal entity and being due to or from the same tax authority are\\noffset on the balance sheet.\\nFRS 102 requires that investments are valued each year on the mark-to-market basis and the revaluation\\ndifferences are reflected in the profit and loss account. However, the tax on any unrealised profit is calculated and\\nshown in the accounts as if the profit had been realised, but there is then an adjustment in the deferred tax to\\nmove the tax that relates to the unrealised profit to the balance sheet.\\nForeign Currencies\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the\\nexchange rate ruling at the reporting date, unless specifically covered by foreign exchange contracts whereupon\\nthe contract rate is used.\\nInvestments\\nCurrent investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices.\\nInvestments in unlisted company shares are remeasured to available market values, or Directors’ valuations at\\neach balance sheet date.  Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive\\nincome for the period. As at 30 September 2022 unlisted shares were valued at £nil (2021: £nil).\\nInvestments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date under level 1\\nof the fair value hierachy. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive\\nincome for the period.\\nDividend income is recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established from\\ninvestee companies.\\nFinancial instruments:\\nTrade and other receivables\\nTrade and other receivables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently\\nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.\\nCash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks.\\n39\\n', \"\\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\\nFOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022\\n3.

Our vision is to build a company for the new era and the past twelve months have seen us consolidate and integrate across what has become our foundational platform.\\nBrave Bison operates across four business pillars:\\nBrave Bison Performance is a digital media advertising practice. We plan and buy media on platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, Amazon and YouTube. All of our work is focused on helping our customers drive conversion metrics such sales, downloads and subscriptions. Customers include New Balance, Curry's and Asus.\\nBrave Bison Commerce is a digital commerce practice. We provide technology services to help customers design and build next generation ecommerce platforms. Our teams use the latest MACH technology from partners such as Salesforce, Adobe, SAP and BigCommerce to design, launch, upgrade and support best-in-class ecommerce systems. Customers include Viking Direct, MKM Building Supplies and Muller.\\nBrave Bison Social & Influencer (re-branded to Social Chain as of February 2023) is a social media advertising practice. We create content for customers on social media platforms and work with influencers to make and distribute content. This creative approach ensures that content is native to the platform, leading to higher engagements from audiences. Customers include Panasonic, Vodafone, WWF and Rapyd.\\nBrave Bison Media Network is a portfolio of channels across YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. These channels generate over 1 billion monthly views, and the advertising inventory from each channel is sold through online advertising exchanges. Popular channels include The Hook, PGA Tour, US Open and Link Up TV.\\nWhilst each of our business pillars is led by a Managing Director and supported by department heads, the Brave Bison platform is one of connection and collaboration. We have worked hard over the past year to ensure that, despite our four centres of excellence, we operate as one company, with a shared vision that aligns across each of our business pillars.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nYear in Review:\\n2022 was a strong year for Brave Bison. During the period revenue grew by 46% to almost £32m, gross profit more than doubled to just under £17m and the company generated adjusted EBITDA of over £3m, a YoY increase of 71%. At year end our balance sheet remained strong with net cash of over £6m, after having completed our third acquisition since Theo, Philippa and I joined the company mid 2020.\\n\"We operate from trend to spend for our customers\"\\nDuring the period the Leadership Team maintained a sharp operational focus. We completed the integration of four businesses, made our third acquisition, and relaunched an enhanced value and service proposition under a refreshed Brave Bison brand. This integrated and connected approach has already proven its ability to attract new customers and allow for effective cross selling across our four business units.\\nBest Response Media (BRM) was acquired during the period and integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. Until the acquisition, our efforts at Brave Bison Commerce were focused on three major enterprise ecommerce platforms: SAP, Salesforce and BigCommerce. Through the acquisition of BRM, we are now able to offer services on Adobe Commerce Cloud, a ubiquitous platform that has grown from strength-to-strength in recent years. Furthermore, we acquired a highly experienced and flexible resource base in Mansoura, Egypt, as well as Tier 1 customers including NatWest.\\nBrave Bison is headquartered in London, but the business operates across the world. We have staff in 11 countries and almost a quarter of our team works remotely. Furthermore, over 50% of our staff work on a hybrid basis, often choosing to come into the office between one and three days per week. This new way of working is an important part of our strategy moving forward and is telling of the digital age we are leaning into as a business. Our hybrid and remote workforce enables us to hire more quickly, cheaply and often from a more diverse pool of talent. This approach also means that, as we scale and grow our teams, we can keep property costs low whilst maintaining a strong culture through a mixture of virtual team events and quarterly in person socials.\\nTheo and I are committed to developing Brave Bison\\'s board in a thoughtful and measured way, in line with modern standards of governance. The appointment of Gordon Brough as non-executive director during the period is a further indication of this commitment. Gordon has extensive experience in UK public companies having been General Counsel at Aberdeen Asset Management plc (subsequently the asset management arm of Abrdn) for almost 10 years. Gordon\\'s legal experience, as well as his expertise in acquisitions will be crucial to the business as we look to further bolster our corporate profile.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nOutlook:\\nWe are mindful of macroeconomic challenges over the next 12-18 months, but have confidence in the prevailing trend that continues to shift marketing budgets away from traditional advertising and into digital channels. Furthermore, our position in this expanding marketplace is differentiated and growing from strength-to-strength.\\nThis organic growth will be compounded by our carefully considered Acquisition & Integration strategy that has proven successful to date. Our Leadership Team is both capable and focussed, and we anticipate that the acquisition of Social Chain (completed in February 2023) will have a transformative impact on our ability to win and deliver for customers in the social media advertising space.\\nOliver Green\\nExecutive Chairman\\n26 April 2023\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nCFO'S REVIEW:\\n2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison.\\nRevenue increased by 46% to £31.7 million (2021: £21.7 million), gross profit increased by 117% to £16.9 million (2021: £7.8 million) and adjusted profit before tax, a measure of underlying profitability, increased by 86% to £2.6 million (2021: £1.4 million).\\nOrganic growth of gross profit, removing the impact of businesses acquired during the period, was £1.8 million, or approximately 12%.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nPrincipal Activities:\\nBrave Bison has two business models.\\nFirstly, the provision of digital advertising and technology services to global blue-chip companies. Services provided include social media advertising, influencer marketing, paid media services, search engine optimisation services, ecommerce software integration, ecommerce system design and others. Customers include New Balance, Muller, Primark and Asus. This operation is referred to as \"fee based services\" in the Group segmental reporting.\\nThe digital advertising and technology services business unit showed good growth during the year. Revenues increased by 169% to £19.7 million (2021: £7.3 million) and the gross profit approximately tripled to £14.0 million (2021: £4.8 million). In line with our acquisition and integration strategy, Greenlight Digital was integrated into Brave Bison Performance, and Greenlight Commerce and Best Response Media were integrated into Brave Bison Commerce.\\nSecondly, Brave Bison owns and operates a network of social and digital media channels. These channels principally exist on platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. Brave Bison publishes content on these channels which attract views and serve advertising which can be bought programmatically through digital advertising platforms. This operation is referred to as \"advertising\" in Group segmental reporting.\\nThe advertising business unit generated revenue of £11.9 million (2021: £14.3 million) and approximately 1.3 billion views (2021: 1.7 billion). This decrease year-on-year largely relates to channels that are operated but not owned by Brave Bison on a revenue share basis, therefore the underlying gross profit remained broadly flat at £2.9 million (2021: £3.0 million). The small drop in gross profit was largely due to a softening of CPMs (cost per mille) in the second half of the year in response to macro-economic conditions. As we saw during the pandemic, this part of our business can be sensitive to such conditions, but tends to recover swiftly.\\n\"2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison\"\\nMargins & Operations\\nBrave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit before tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance indicator to measure the Group\\'s financial performance.\\nThe adjusted profit margin for the period was 15.4% (2021: 17.9%) a decrease year-on-year. This decrease was driven by the tripling of digital advertising and technology services net revenues which operates at a lower adjusted profit margin than advertising generated on the media network.\\nDespite the decrease in adjusted profit margin, Brave Bison has completed a number of initiatives to reduce the underlying operating costs of the business. These include a reduction in property costs through sub-letting excess office space, reduction in IT costs as business units are merged and careful resource management to reduce the staff cost to net revenue ratio for billable customers.\\nExceptional Costs & Adjustments\\nDuring the year Brave Bison incurred restructuring costs of £0.1 million (2021:£0.2 million), relating to the restructuring and expansion of the Group\\'s operations in Bulgaria, and acquisition costs of £0.1 million (2021: £0.7 million) relating to the costs associated with acquiring Best Response Media.\\nBrave Bison carried out a purchase price allocation exercise during the year in relation to the Greenlight acquisitions which completed in 2021, which resulted in identification of intangible assets relating to the acquired brands and customer relationships. As a result of the rebranding, and retirement of the Greenlight trade brand during the year, the amounts relating to this were impaired in full during the year, resulting in an impairment charge of £0.5 million (2021: £nil). The customer relationships are being amortised over a period of 10 years, resulting in a charge of £0.2 million (2021: £nil). As we deliver on our acquisition and integration strategy it is likely that both the amortisation of acquired intangibles, and impairment of acquired brands retired post-integration will continue to impact our financial statements.\\nEquity settled share-based payments relate to the value of share awards that have been granted to employees of the Group. £0.3 million of this amount relates to the directors\\' LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors\\' Remuneration Report. The earliest possible redemption date is December 2024, and redemption is contingent on the share price exceeding 3.0 pence.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that the Group uses to measure its performance and is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions and share based payments. It should be noted that a portion of the property costs in both 2022 and 2021 fall into the finance costs and depreciation lines as a result of the introduction of IFRS 16 \\'Leases\\'.\\nAs a result, the Group also uses Adjusted profit before tax as a measure of performance, which is stated after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions, share based payments, impairments and amortisation of acquired intangibles, but which is after the deduction of costs associated with property leases.\\n: Adjusted EBITDA, 2022 £000\\'s: 3,020, 2021 £000\\'s: 1,762\\n: Finance costs, 2022 £000\\'s: (86), 2021 £000\\'s: (67)\\n: Finance income, 2022 £000\\'s: 80, 2021 £000\\'s: -\\n: Depreciation, 2022 £000\\'s: (382), 2021 £000\\'s: (279)\\n: Adjusted Profit before tax, 2022 £000\\'s: 2,632, 2021 £000\\'s: 1,416\\n: Restructuring costs, 2022 £000\\'s: (62), 2021 £000\\'s: (176)\\n: Acquisition costs, 2022 £000\\'s: (56), 2021 £000\\'s: (686)\\n: Impairment charge, 2022 £000\\'s: (456), 2021 £000\\'s: -\\n: Amortisation of acquired intangibles, 2022 £000\\'s: (215), 2021 £000\\'s: (34)\\n: Equity settled share based payments*, 2022 £000\\'s: (387), 2021 £000\\'s: (62)\\n: Profit before tax, 2022 £000\\'s: 1,456, 2021 £000\\'s: 458\\n*£0.3 million of the equity settled share based payments is a non-cash charge related to the director\\'s LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors\\' Remuneration Report.\\nFinancial Position\\nBrave Bison ended the period with cash resources of £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million) and net cash after deducting outstanding bank loans of £6.2 million (2021: £4.7 million). The bank loan relates to a Government-backed CBIL that is repayable over six years from drawdown.\\nIn addition to the CBIL, Brave Bison has a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank for a total of £3 million, with an interest margin of 2.75% over Base Rate. This was agreed during the period but was undrawn at the period end.\\nThe Group had cash inflow of £0.6 million during the period (2021: £3.2 million inflow), and expects to maintain positive cashflow throughout 2023. The decrease in cash inflow is largely due to a large customer prepayment received at the end of 2021, which subsequently unwound during the period.\\n\\n', '\\n\\nIn addition to this, the cashflow generated from operating activities was used to fund the acquisition of Best Response Media (£0.3 million) and the payment of deferred consideration in respect of the Greenlight acquisition made in 2021 (£0.8 million).:\\nThe Group is carrying intangible assets of £6.3 million (2021: £6.3 million). Based on an interim fair value exercise the Group capitalised goodwill of £0.2 million (2021: £6.2 million) on the purchase of Best Response Media (2021: Greenlight).

Employees of the Group receive regular appraisals and performance reviews, and all-company meetings are held weekly to provide company updates. The Group conducts staff surveys to monitor progress of employment initiatives and areas for improvement. The Group is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to furthering diversity and inclusion throughout the business.:\\nAppropriate policies and procedures are in place to ensure the Group complies with relevant legislation and regulations.\\nShareholders\\nThe Board is committed to open and transparent communications with all shareholder groups. The Directors have regular conversations with major shareholders, and the Group uses a stockbroker to manage professional investor relationships and introduce new professional investors. Furthermore, the Group utilises free-to-use platforms to enable retail investors to engage with the Group, attend the AGM and receive presentations on financial performance and strategy.\\nCustomers, Platforms & Suppliers\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nThe Group's customers are the clients and channel partners who appoint the Group to undertake programmes of work.

The Group has dedicated teams that meet regularly with each platform, and discuss current performance, new opportunities and new products.\\nThe Group has long-standing relationships with suppliers and treats all suppliers fairly. Contractual commitments to suppliers are met within a timely manner.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nPRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES:\\nRisk: Dependence on key personnel and employees, Potential Risk Description: The continued success of the Group depends partly upon the performance and expertise of its current and future key executives and personnel. A lack of skilled workforce could result in a drop in service levels and customer dissatisfaction, and therefore have an adverse impact on the Group in terms of its reputation. The loss of such individuals, or the failure to train and attract other high calibre individuals may impact on the Group's business and the Group's ability to achieve its targets., Mitigating Factors: The Group ensures all its employees are supported and managed by way of regular performance appraisals. Furthermore, the Group incentivises key employees using performance-related bonus plans and share option awards that vest over a multi-year period.\\nRisk: Competitive industry dynamics, Potential Risk Description: The Group operates in a highly complex and rapidly changing industry. If the Group is not able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected., Mitigating Factors: The Board believes the Group has adopted a competitive business strategy to increase the profits of the business. The Group has implemented an acquisitive business model to improve its capabilities and scale within the markets which it operates. Furthermore, the Group maintains a substantial net cash position to provide flexibility in the event of a more competitive and less profitable trading environment.\\nRisk: Dependence on the operating policies of key platforms, Potential Risk Description: The Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue from three international technology platforms which are subject to external factors beyond the Group's control. Changes to the commercial agreements or policies implemented by these platforms could have a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group has diversified its business model away from the advertising platforms, which now only account for 38% (FY21: 66%) of the Group's revenues. Furthermore, the Group has diversified its revenues between three platforms to reduce the impact of any single platform policy change.\\nRisk: Impact of Pandemics, Potential Risk Description: A pandemic could cause an adverse impact on the Group's financial position. Customer marketing budgets could reduce, which may result in lower revenues. The Group's employees may be unable to service customers due to sickness or disruption to the Group's operations., Mitigating Factors: The Group operates a robust hybrid working system where its employees are not normally required to be physically present in an office in order to deliver work for customers.\\nRisk: Foreign Currency Risk, Potential Risk Description: The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange movements in the US dollar. These movements could result in a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposure. All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement on translation at the reporting date.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nOPERATIONAL REPORT:\\nThe Brave Bison Business Model\\nEvery year many trillions of physical and digital products and services are sold online, and in 2021 over half a trillion dollars was spent advertising these products and services across digital platforms.

Nevertheless, we continue to aim to reduce our environmental impact.\\nOur sustainability strategy has 3 pillars, emissions, waste & recycling and consumables.\\nCarbon emissions:\\nAs a service business our energy use is by far our biggest contributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity and gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal (non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with simple but effective office measures.\\nThe most important of these is our pledge to offset actual carbon emissions or the highest year of emissions – providing a direct incentive to staff to save energy, since any reduction below our worst year translates into the business being carbon negative. This is critical and, we believe, unique, as it removes the implicit \"permission to emit\" that carbon offsetting programmes can otherwise create.\\nCarbon Emissions are classified as Scope 1, 2 or 3. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, Scope 2 is made up of indirect emissions that a company is directly responsible for, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and emissions from public transport made on company business, and Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that the company is indirectly responsible for. Scope 3 is wide and includes emissions from cloud computing, emissions associated with the manufacture of office equipment and much more.\\nOur Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions are measured in the first half of each year for the prior year. We partner with specialist consultants Carbon Footprint Ltd to assess and verify our footprint. The assessment includes rigorous estimates of the impact of our people working from home, which they now do a significant proportion of the time. From this year we intend our reports will cover the entirety of Scope 3 emissions, making 2022 the first year a complete and unflinching benchmark of our Carbon Footprint has been made.\\nOur offsetting programme is a blend of avoided deforestation (REDD) in the Amazon, reforesting in Africa, UK tree planting, and clean cooking technology in rural China and India (where wood and coal burning is otherwise prevalent). Finally, we plant 15 trees for every new client win or renewed client contract in our Tree Nation forest.\\nAs our measurement to date has been for Scopes 1, 2 and part of Scope 3, we only claim Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality (or carbon negativity in years where our offsetting is greater than our emissions). Following 2022\\'s Carbon Footprint assessment which we expect to be complete by the end of May, it\\'s our ambition to make a Net Zero commitment in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative, accompanied by a plan to reach Net Zero across all scopes.\\nOther measures include automatic timers on our TV\\'s and communication with our staff about the impact their energy use has. Travel was significantly reduced as a result of COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel where possible.\\nWaste & Recycling\\nThe Group operates a largely paperless office. All employees are advised that documents and emails should not be printed, instead accessed via shared digital drives. When required, printers are set to double-sided and black and white, the aim being to reduce the use of both paper and toner.\\nWe have long been a Group that aims to recycle as much waste as possible. We have clearly labelled recycling points stationed around the offices, and avoid bins at desks to encourage their use.\\nConsumables\\nWe have an ongoing programme designed to minimise the environmental impact of our consumption beyond greenhouse gases and recycling.\\nLivestock farming generates a significant percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, with red meat and dairy producing the majority of this. A third of the water used for farming goes toward rearing farm animals. Soy and oat milk alternatives are provided, again reducing our dairy farming impact while avoiding water intensive almond milk. From this year, our ambition is to stop the routine purchase of any meat in food bought for staff and clients, with exceptions only for special events and requests.\\nWe have removed all plastic bottled water from our London office and installed fresh still and sparkling water taps instead, avoiding over 600 single use plastic bottles every month.\\nLastly, we only buy 100% recycled paper for our office printers.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nSOCIAL:\\nBrave Bison is committed to developing a diverse workforce, an inclusive culture and the removal of barriers for underrepresented groups.\\n56% of employees are male and 44% of employees are female. Within the Senior Leadership Team, 70% are male and 30% are female. During 2022 we carried out a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging survey, and from the responses 35% of employees self-identify as being from an ethnic minority background.\\nBrave Bison seeks to achieve the highest ethical standards and behaviours in conducting its business, with integrity, openness, diversity and inclusiveness being high priority from the Board to senior management and throughout the workforce.\\nThe Company has adopted a formal equal opportunities policy which is contained in our employee handbook. The aim of the policy is to ensure no job applicant, employee or worker is discriminated against either directly or indirectly on the grounds of race, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender reassignment; marriage or civil partnership; pregnancy or maternity; religion or belief or age.\\nIn conducting our business and developing strategy we have placed greater emphasis on social and environmental considerations, embarking on a number of initiatives including:\\n• Running diversity and inclusion and unconscious bias training for all staff;\\n• Monthly 'Lunch & Learn' sessions where we have guest speakers from various sectors and backgrounds;\\n• Encouraging employees to take two paid days to volunteer in the local community; and\\n• Offering unlimited online coaching for all staff.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nGOVERNANCE:\\nThe Board believes that governance is central to the effective delivery of our mission and strategy. With this in mind, the Board is committed to ensuring that all decision-making and the oversight it provides promotes success for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, while being respectful of the interests of other key stakeholders. This includes our partners, customers and employees.\\nThe Board has a strong balance of industry knowledge and financial experience. We have established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated duties and responsibilities and with written terms of reference. From time to time, separate committees may be set up by the Board to consider specific issues when the need arises.\\nGovernance Report\\nIn this section\\n16 Board of Directors\\n18 Corporate Governance\\n21 Audit & Risk Committee Report\\n22 Remuneration Committee Report\\n24 Directors' Report\\n25 Statement of Directors' Responsibilities\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nBOARD OF DIRECTORS:\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nOLIVER GREEN:\\nExecutive Chairman\\nOli is Executive Chairman of Brave Bison and has worked in digital marketing and technology for the past 10 years.

The Executive Chairman will meet regularly with the Independent Directors to discuss the operation of the Board and strategy.:\\nThe Board aims to convene 6 times a year, with additional meetings being held as required. Board meetings are a mix of virtual and in person.\\nPrior to their appointment, the Company informed each Director of the nature of their role, their responsibilities and duties to the Company, and the time commitment involved. On appointment, each Director confirmed that, taking into account all of their other commitments, they were able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their role effectively.

The Group\\'s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the CFO\\'s Review on pages 6-7, and Principal Risks and Uncertainties on page 9.

Going Concern:\\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, and at least for 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements. The Group is dependent for its working capital requirements on cash generated from operations, and cash holdings. The cash holdings of the Group at 31 December 2022 were £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million). The Group made a profit before tax of £1.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £0.5 million), and generated an increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of £0.6 million (2021: £3.2 million). The Group has net assets of £10.0 million (2021: £7.5 million).\\nThe Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections for the period to 31 December 2023 and for the following 6 month period to 30 June 2024 which are based on their current expectations of trading prospects. The Group achieved positive cashflow of £1.1 million in H2 2022, and the Board forecasts that the Group will continue to achieve positive cash inflows in 2023.\\nThe Directors are confident that the Group's cash flow projections are achievable, and are committed to taking any actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in forecast revenue receipts is mitigated by cost savings.\\nThe Directors continue to maintain rolling forecasts which are regularly updated.\\nThe Directors remain confident that the Group has sufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and accordingly, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.\\nBasis of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Brave Bison Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2022, with comparative information presented for the year ended 31 December 2021.

All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December and are consolidated from the acquisition date, which is the date from which control passes to Brave Bison Group plc.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n2.2. Adoption of new and revised standards:\\nThe Group has applied the following amendments:\\n• IFRS 3 – Reference to the Conceptual Framework;\\n• IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use;\\n• IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract; and\\n• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 – 2020 Cycle.\\nOther Standards and amendments that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company include:\\n• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies;\\n• Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Estimates;\\n• Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction;\\n• Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current;\\n• Amendments to IAS 1 – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants; and\\n• Amendments to IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.\\nThe directors have assessed the standards above and they will not have a material impact in future periods.\\n3 Statement of compliance\\nThe financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies and presentation required by UK adopted International Accounting Standards, and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (\"IFRIC\") Interpretations as endorsed for use in the UK. The financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are relevant to companies that prepare financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards.\\n4 Summary of accounting policies\\nThe Group\\'s presentation and functional currency is £ (Sterling). The financial statements are presented in thousands of pounds (£000\\'s) unless otherwise stated.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.1. Revenue:\\nRevenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nRevenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity, the costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably, and when the criteria for each of the Group's different activities has been met.:\\n\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nThe determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgement and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. The Group is deemed to be acting as a principal in all significant contracts.:\\nThe accounting policies specific to the Group's key operating revenue categories are outlined below:\\nAdvertising revenue:\\n• Ad-funded YouTube channel management of third party content owners' videos. Revenue is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligation of delivering monetised views occurs;\\n• Monetisation of the Group's owned and operated brands and videos via platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat.

Government grants:\\nGovernment grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.\\nA grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met. Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability. Government grants are presented as a deduction from the related expense.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.4. Foreign currency translation:\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.\\nAny exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.\\nThe assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate on the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries and on income and expenses during the year are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the \"translation reserve\" in equity.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.5.

The Group will provide a split between these two pillars, as well as a split by geographical location. Segmental information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented within Note 6.:\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n4.6. Leasing:\\nFor any new contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. To apply this definition the Group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether:\\n• The contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Group;\\n• The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract;\\n• The Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Group assess whether it has the right to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset is used throughout the period of use.\\nAt lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right‑of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received).\\nThe Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.\\nAt the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate.\\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.\\nSubsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments.\\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use is already reduced to zero.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n4.7. Property, plant and equipment:\\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives less estimated residual values, using the straight line method. The rates generally applicable are:\\n• Fixtures & Fittings – 3 years or over remaining lease term\\n• Computer Equipment – 3 years\\nThe gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nThe assets' residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.:\\nThe Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n4.8. Impairment of property, plant and equipment:\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.:\\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\nWhere an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\nIntangible assets\\nAn intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.\\nIntangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, are shown at fair value at the date of the acquisition less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to profit or loss. The rates applicable, which represent the Directors' best estimate of the useful economic life, are:\\n• Customer relationships – 5 to 10 years\\n• Online channel content – 3 to 5 years\\n• Brands – 3 years\\n• Technology – 1 to 5 years\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nGoodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as outlined below.:\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.9. Impairment of intangible assets:\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nAt each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.:\\nRecoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.\\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.10. Development costs:\\nExpenditure on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:\\n• Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;\\n• The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;\\n• The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and the asset will generate probable future economic benefits (over and above cost);\\n• There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and\\n• The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably.\\nDevelopment costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include employee (other than Director) costs incurred along with third party costs.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n4.11. Investments in associates and joint ventures:\\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures is increased or decreased to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Group.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n4.12. Taxation:\\nTax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.\\nCurrent tax\\nThe tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.\\nDeferred tax\\nDeferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be recognised.\\nSuch assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n4.13. Financial Instruments:\\nRecognition and derecognition\\nFinancial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.\\nLoan and other receivables\\nThe Group accounts for loan and other receivables by recording the loss allowance as lifetime expected credit losses. These are shortfalls in contractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at any point during the life of the financial instrument. The Group uses its historical experience, external indicators and forward-looking information to calculate expected credit losses.\\nTrade and other payables\\nTrade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.\\nContract assets and liabilities\\nThe Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n4.14. Equity, reserves and dividend payments:\\nShare capital\\nShare capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.\\nShare premium\\nShare premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium arising on those shares, net of any related income tax benefits.\\nRetained deficits\\nRetained deficits include all current and prior period retained profits or losses. It also includes credits arising from share based payment charges.\\nTranslation reserve\\nTranslation reserve represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.\\nMerger reserve\\nThe merger reserve is created when group reconstruction accounting is applied. The difference between the cost of investment and the nominal value of the share capital acquired is recognised in a merger reserve.\\nMerger relief reserve\\nWhere the following conditions are met, any excess consideration received over the nominal value of the shares issued is recognised in the merger relief reserve:\\n• the consideration for shares in another company includes issued shares; and\\n• on completion of the transaction, the company issuing the shares will have secured at least a 90% equity holding in the other company.\\nCapital redemption reserve\\nWhere the Company purchases its own equity share capital, on cancellation, the nominal value of the shares cancelled is deducted from share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.\\nDividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in 'other liabilities' when the dividends have been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n4.15. Cash and cash equivalents:\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, together with other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash having maturities of 3 months or less from inception and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, and bank overdrafts.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.16. Employee benefits:\\nThe Group operates two schemes on behalf of its employees, private healthcare and a defined contribution pension plan and amounts due are expensed as they fall due.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n4.17. Share based payments:\\nEmployees (including Directors) of the Group received remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares ('equity-settled transactions'). The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments to all grants of equity instruments. The transactions have been treated as equity settled.\\nThe cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instrument granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding charge to equity, over the period between the date of grant and the end of a vesting period, where relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. The total value of the options has been pro-rated and allocated on a weighted average basis.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n4.18. Restructuring Costs:\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\nRestructuring costs relate to corporate re-organisation activities previously undertaken or announced, as detailed in note 8.:\\n\\n\\n', '\\n\\n4.19. Provisions:\\n\\n\\n', \"\\n\\nThe Group has recognised a provision for the costs to restore leased property to its original condition, as required by the terms and conditions of the lease. This is recognised when the obligation is incurred, either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period of the lease, at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to restore the assets. Estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for new circumstances.:\\n5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\\nThe preparation of financial statements under UK adopted International Accounting Standards requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n5.1. Critical accounting judgements:\\nIntangible assets and impairment\\nThe Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is determined by experts engaged by management and based upon management's and the Directors' judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore management must estimate the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.\\nTrade receivables' recovery\\nWithin trade debtors there is a balance of £0.7 million (2021: £0.7 million) which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is because it believes it is recoverable, since there is a trade payable balance of £0.8 million (2021: £0.8 million) with the same company, and the Group is anticipating reaching agreement that these balances may be set off against each other.\\nTreatment of revenue as agent or principal\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nThe determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. These include if the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service, if the Group has inventory risk before the good or services has been transferred to the customer and if the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the good or service.:\\nDeferred taxation\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.\\nGreenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation\\nThe purchase price allocation of the Greenlight acquisition was fully assessed in the year, within the one year IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, and acquired intangibles were identified and a full valuation exercise carried out in relation to the Greenlight trade name and the customer relationships. The purchase price has been reallocated accordingly.\\nBest Response Media acquisition and purchase price allocation\\nThe purchase price allocation of the Best Response Media acquisition was provisionally assessed, and the Group judged that at the interim valuation stage it was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. A full valuation exercise will be completed within the one year IFRS3 measurement period from the date of acquisition which may recognise additional intangible assets separately from goodwill.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n5.2. Estimates:\\nShare based payment charges\\nThe Group is required to measure the fair value of its share based payments. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes method which requires assumptions regarding exchange rate volatility, the risk free rate, share price volatility and the expected life of the share based payment. Exchange rate volatility is calculated using historic data over the past three years. The volatility of the Group's share price has been calculated as the average of similar listed companies over the preceding periods. The risk-free rate range used is between 0% and 1.25% and management, including the Directors, have estimated the expected life of most share based payments to be 4 years.\\nBad debt provision\\nRecoverability of some receivables may be doubtful although not definitely irrecoverable. Where management feel recoverability is in doubt an appropriate provision is made for the possibility that the amounts may not be recovered in full. Provisions are made using past experience however subjectivity is involved when assessing the level of provision required.\\n6 Segment Reporting\\nGeographic reporting\\nThe Group has identified three geographic areas (United Kingdom & Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the world) and the information is presented based on the customers' location.\\n: Revenue, 2022 £000's: , 2021 £000's:\\n: United Kingdom & Europe, 2022 £000's: 28,493, 2021 £000's: 17,548\\n: Asia Pacific, 2022 £000's: 311, 2021 £000's: 894\\n: Rest of the world, 2022 £000's: 2,848, 2021 £000's: 3,218\\n: Total revenue, 2022 £000's: 31,652, 2021 £000's: 21,660\\nThe Group identifies two revenue streams, advertising and fee based services, which correspond to the Media Network and Digital Advertising and Technology Services pillars respectively.

This grouping is determined based on the lowest level of significant inputs used in fair value measurement, as follows:\\n• level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n• level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\\n• level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\\nThe Group categorises all financial assets and liabilities as level 1.\\nMaturity analysis\\nSet out below is a maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities.

The consideration was financed by existing cash balances. Best Response Media Limited is a specialist ecommerce and mobile development company focused exclusively on the Adobe Commerce Platform.\\nThe provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:\\n: Goodwill, Book value £000's: 239, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 239\\n: Tangible Assets, Book value £000's: 1, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1\\n: Trade and other receivables, Book value £000's: 237, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 237\\n: Cash and cash equivalents, Book value £000's: 840, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 840\\n: Current Liabilities, Book value £000's: (143), Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: (143)\\n: , Book value £000's: 1,174, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1,174\\nThe consideration for the acquisition was as follows:\\n: Initial cash consideration – paid, £000's: 962\\n: Completion accounts adjustment – paid, £000's: 37\\n: Deferred cash consideration – paid, £000's: 175\\n: , £000's: 1,174\\nThe consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes £0.1 million of acquisition costs in relation to Best Response Media Limited.\\nThe fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of £0.2 million and a gross contractual value of £0.3 million. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.1 million. The goodwill represents the acquired accumulated workforce and the synergies expected from integrating Best Response Media into the Group's existing business. The Group has carried out an interim fair value adjustment exercise and will be completing a full exercise within the one year measurement period from the date of the acquisition in accordance with IFRS3. At the interim valuation stage the Group has not been able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other identifiable assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. Once the full valuation exercise has been completed additional intangible assets may be recognised separately from goodwill.\\nBest Response Media Limited contributed £0.5 million revenue and £0.2 million loss to the Group's profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the reporting date.\\nIf the acquisition of Best Response Media Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been £32 million and Group profit would have been £1.9 million.\\n30 Post balance sheet events\\nOn the 3 February 2023 the Group announced the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital of Social Chain Limited. The initial consideration for the acquisition consisted of a payment of £7.7m. This was partially funded by way of an oversubscribed vendor placing to raise £4.75 million. Social Chain is one of the UK's leading social media and influencer marketing agencies. The completion balance sheet in relation to the acquisition is still being prepared, and therefore a breakdown of the assets and liabilities acquired has not been disclosed.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nCOMPANY

Starvest’s strategy\\nto steer its portfolio toward precious metal investments in recent years has enabled the Company to position itself\\nattractively for the current environment. Although improved investor sentiment boosted certain precious metal\\nstocks and those of certain other natural resource companies, gold prices declined 5.5% for the year ended 30\\nSeptember 2022. The post-pandemic global economy and interest rate hikes, particularly in the US, have kept\\nprices flat recently but we continue to believe that there is a solid foundation for precious metals going forward.\\nOur investment portfolio decreased approximately 56% in the year to 30 September 2022 to £6 million. However,\\nthe discount to net asset value narrowed by 5 percentage points, from 34% to 29% as at 30 September 2022,\\nwhich is a significant improvement for shareholders.\\nGreatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in\\nAustralia. Havieron’s initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent* to 6.5M oz gold equivalent\\nduring the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered\\noperational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not\\nuncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.\\nAriana Resources continues to expand its exploration and development footprint in Europe. As the Kiziltepe mine\\nhas continued to meet production expectations, Ariana has focused on other projects in Turkey, such as Tavsan,\\nwhich is scheduled for first production in H2 2023. The alliance with Newmont, via its West Tethyan holding, allows\\nconsiderable scope to explore southeastern Europe over the next five years, and the recently acquired Kosovo\\nlicence shows an interesting start to this US$2.5m agreement. Together with the Asgard Metals Fund, Ariana’s\\nexploration and development projects have expanded considerably since the company’s founding twenty years\\nago.\\nCora Gold continued to de-risk its Sanankoro project as it completed further drilling and increased its mineral\\nresource estimate by 14% while completing a feasibility study. After year-end the company announced that it had\\nreceived the Environmental Permit required for the project, a significant step forward.\\nWe believe that the long-term outlook for gold prices remains favourable and we remain committed to our\\nstrategy.\\n* GGP RNS dated 10 December 2020       GGP RNS dated 3 March 2022\\nInvesting policy\\nThe Company’s investing policy is set forth on page 3 of this report and made available on our website,\\nwww.starvest.co.uk.\\nTrading portfolio valuation\\nA brief review of the major portfolio companies follows from page 6.

Following the appointment of Callum Baxter as Chairman in 2015, the\\nBoard continued to focus the Company’s investment strategy on the natural resources sector.\\nCollectively, the current Board has significant experience investing in small-capitalisation new issues and pre-IPO\\nopportunities in the natural resources and mineral exploration sectors.\\nCompany objective\\nThe Company was established as a source of early-stage finance to fledgling businesses to maximise the capital\\nvalue of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest\\ndividends.\\nInvesting strategy\\nNatural resources:  Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the\\nBoard sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were\\ngenerally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the\\nnature of the public equity markets has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio\\nwill include companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the\\nappropriate financial backing, developing a commercial resource.\\nDirect Projects: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target\\ncompanies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects\\nand subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct\\nproject interests. Those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be\\noperated by the investee company; Starvest does not intend to manage any projects. The addition of the Direct\\nProject strategy to the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual\\ngeneral meeting held 1 December 2017.\\nInvestment size:  Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies invariably have an\\nongoing need for additional funding to continue exploration and development. Therefore, after appropriate due\\ndiligence, the Company may provide further funding support and make later market purchases, so that the total\\ninvestment may exceed £100,000.\\nHigh risk:  The business is inherently high risk and cyclical, dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity\\nwhich affects the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the opportunity to participate in\\ndiverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for significant returns for the\\nforeseeable future.\\nLack of liquidity:  Shares of investee companies typically trade in small volumes, even if they are quoted on AIM,\\nAQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, during the early phase following an investment, it is rarely possible to liquidate\\na position at the quoted market price so investors must remain patient until the investee company develops and\\nultimately attracts greater market interest. If and when an exploration company finds a large exploitable resource,\\nit typically presents greater liquidity to patient investors as an acquisition target by a third party or as a much larger\\nand more actively traded independent entity.\\nSuccess rate:  Of the multiple investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove\\nto be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, we\\nexpect that over time portfolio returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is unable to give\\nany estimate of the magnitude or timing of returns.\\nProfit distribution:  When profits have been realised, and adequate cash is available, the Board intends to\\ndistribute up to half the profits realised.\\n3\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\nInvesting policy statement, continued\\nInvesting strategy, continued\\nOther matters:  The Company currently has an investment in Equity Resources Limited, which itself is an\\ninvestment company.\\nThe Company takes no part in the active management of investee companies, although directors of the Company\\nhave served as directors on the boards of such companies.\\n4\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\nReview of trading portfolio:\\nIntroduction\\nDuring the year to 30 September 2022, the portfolio comprised interests in the companies discussed below, as\\nwell as other active companies that are not discussed herein.\\nThe economic shock of the global pandemic continued throughout 2022 and investors’ desire for traditional safe-\\nhaven assets boosted precious metals stocks at times. However, supply chain issues and European conflict led\\nto rising energy prices, broader-based inflation and a shift in economic policies which caused market reactions\\nand precious metal price fluctuations as well as an overall decline year on year in metal prices when forecasts for\\ngrowth were downgraded. In this environment, we believe our strategy to focus on investments in gold producers\\nwill prove to be rewarding on a risk-adjusted basis for our shareholders. However, during the year to 30 September\\n2022, the value of our trading portfolio decreased ~56% due to lower market prices for major positions. Including\\nour cash position, our net asset value (“NAV”) and NAV per share decreased 53.4% and 53.7%, respectively, over\\nthe 12-month period to 30 September 2022. Given that Starvest’s market capitalisation decreased approximately\\n49%, the discount to NAV narrowed to 29% compared to 34% a year ago.\\nTransactions\\nDuring the year the Company did not raise capital through placing or subscription.\\nThe Company disposed of its full holdings in Minera IRL during the year, along with a small portion of its positions\\nin Greatland Gold (3.8m shares at an average price of 12.83p per share) and Ariana Resources (2.2m shares at\\nan average price of 4.25p per share).\\nTrading portfolio valuation\\nAlthough gold prices declined slightly (~5%) year on year, this change masked greater volatility during the 12-\\nmonth period. The Company’s Net Asset Value decreased approximately 53% during the year to 30 September\\n2022 to £6.6m and the Company made a loss before tax of £7,540,842 compared with a loss before tax of\\n£3,861,014 in 2021.\\nHowever, we are pleased that the Company traded at an improved discount to its NAV of 29% compared to 34%\\nthe previous year.\\nAs part of routine operations, the Board regularly reviews its portfolio positions and may make adjustments to its\\nholdings to take advantage of what  it  believes to  be temporary weakness in prices for precious metals.\\nAlternatively, the Board may consider strategic opportunities to better align the Company’s stock price with what\\nit regards as the intrinsic value of the Company’s portfolio.\\nGiven the availability of actual trading prices for many of our portfolio assets, we value our holdings using closing\\nmarket quotes for the periods shown.\\nIn addition, the Company believes it has a strong financial position as it has no outstanding debt and is well-\\npositioned to benefit from further strength in the natural resources sector through its exposure to early-stage\\nprecious metal producers. We believe that worldwide economic growth and increasingly affluent consumers will\\nfuel demand for motor cars, air conditioning, consumer goods, computers, together with materials required in\\nswitching to ‘greener’ technologies and other items that require the development and exploitation of natural\\nresources in order both to produce and power.\\n5\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\nReview of trading portfolio, continued\\nTrading portfolio valuation, continued\\nCompany statistics\\nThe Company considers the following statistics to be its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and is satisfied with\\nthe results achieved in the year given the uncertain market conditions.\\n30 September 2022: 30 September 2021: Изменение (%)\\nTrading portfolio value: £6.2 m: £14.0 m: -55.7%\\nCompany net asset value: £6.6 m: £14.1 m: -53.2%\\nNet asset value per share: 11.3 p: 24.4 p: -53.7%\\nClosing share price: 8.0 p: 16.0 p: -50%\\nShare price discount to net asset value: 29%: 34%: 5 п.п.\\nMarket capitalisation: £4.7 m: £9.3 m: -49.5%\\nSince the fiscal year end, values have improved.

Greatland\\nalso has farm-in and joint venture agreements in place with its major partner, Newcrest Mining Ltd.\\nThe company, in conjunction with Newcrest, has continued to report excellent drilling results from the Havieron\\nproject and increased its Initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate, independently of Newcrest, from 4.2Moz AuEq\\nto 6.5Moz AuEq in March 2022. The increased estimate was ratified in August 2022 when Newcrest released its\\nown resource upgrade. Neither resource takes into account drilling carried out after February 2022, which could\\nyield a significant increase in resource if included. Drilling to date has not yet closed off the deposit, with Havieron\\nremaining open at depth and in multiple directions, allowing for significant resource growth in the future.\\nIn addition, Greatland took several corporate and financial actions this year. Newcrest boosted its stake in\\nHavieron to 70% but declined to exercise an option to acquire an additional 5% of the project. Greatland\\nsubsequently raised US$35m in an over-subscribed placing and is well-funded to continue exploration and funding\\nits part of the Havieron development. In September 2022, the company announced that two former Fortescue\\nMetals Group executives would join the board in January 2023 and also added a former BHP executive, all of\\nwhom add a new dynamic to Greatland’s leadership team and are able to take the company forward as a significant\\nmid-tier developer in the near term. Around the same time, the company entered into a significant finance\\nagreement, with a bank debt facility of A$200m committed through a syndicate of leading international banks and\\nsecured a strategic equity investment of up to A$120m from Wyloo Metals, which will fund Greatland fully through\\nto production.\\nSignificant activities since year end: Greatland announced that drilling permits have been granted on the Ernest\\nGiles licence. Havieron drilling updates continue to confirm the potential to greatly expand the size of this deposit\\nwith high-grade extensions to mineralisation in the Eastern Breccia, South East Crescent Zone and Northern\\nBreccia. The mine decline is at over 900m development length and now in more competent rock. The feasibility\\nstudy is due during 2023 and will likely include more up to date drilling data once completed thus further de-risking\\nthe project.\\nGreatland entered into an option agreement to sell its two Tasmania exploration licences to Flynn Gold for an\\ninitial purchase price of A$200,000 with deferred consideration and a royalty equal to 1% net smelter returns from\\nany future production.\\nAriana Resources plc (www.arianaresources.com)\\nAriana Resources PLC (“Ariana”) is a United Kingdom-based company engaged in the exploration, development\\nand mining of epithermal gold-silver and porphyry copper-gold deposits in Turkey and exploration in Cyprus and\\nsouth-east Europe along with investments in other projects through its metals development fund, Asgard Metals.\\nDuring the year Ariana reported revenue of US$177m at Zenit Madencilik, its investee company, from continued\\nsuccessful production at the Kilitepe mine.

The risk\\narises from the very nature of early-stage mineral exploration where there can be no certainty of outcome. In\\naddition, often there is a lack of liquidity in the Company’s trading portfolio, even for securities quoted on AIM or\\nAQSE, such that the Company may have difficulty in realising the full value in an immediate or forced sale.\\nAccordingly, a commitment is only made after thorough research into both the management and the business of\\nthe target, both of which are closely monitored thereafter.

As the Company grows this matter will be reviewed and\\naddressed with the goal of appointing additional board members and filling a non-executive, independent role.\\nThe Board recognises that it does not fully comply with Principle 7 in that Starvest currently does not have formal\\nevaluation procedures for individual board members but the Board recognises that a formal evaluation process\\nmay become necessary in the near future.\\nQCA CODE:\\n1: Establish a strategy and business model promoting long-term value for shareholders:\\nThe Company is established as a source of early stage finance to fledgling businesses, to maximise the\\ncapital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and\\nmodest dividends.\\nInvesting strategy\\nNatural resources: Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the\\nBoard sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were\\ngenerally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the\\nnature of the market has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio will include\\ncompanies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the appropriate\\nfinancial backing, developing a commercial resource.\\nDirect Project: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target\\ncompanies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects\\nand subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct\\nproject interests; those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be\\noperated by the investee company; Starvest will not manage any project. Prior to selling any projects to corporate\\nentities, Starvest may therefore have an interest in a number of projects. The addition of the Direct Project strategy\\nto the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting held\\n1 December 2017.\\nInvestment size: Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies are invariably not\\ngenerating cash, but rather they have a constant need for additional funding in order to continue exploration and\\ndevelopment. Therefore, after appropriate due diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and\\nmake later market purchases, so that the total investment may be greater than £100,000.\\n19\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\nCorporate governance statement, continued\\nHigh risk: The business is inherently high risk and cyclical in nature dependent upon fluctuations in world\\neconomic activity which impacts on the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the\\nopportunity to participate in diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for\\nsignificant returns for the foreseeable future.\\nLack of liquidity: The investee companies, being small, almost invariably lack share market liquidity, even if they\\nare quoted on AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, in the early years it is rarely possible to sell an investment\\nat the quoted market price with the result that extreme patience is required whilst the investee company develops\\nand ultimately attracts market interest. If and when an explorer finds a large exploitable resource, it may become\\nthe object of a third party bid, or otherwise become a much larger entity; either way an opportunity to realise cash\\nis expected to follow.\\nSuccess rate: Of the 15 to 20 investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove\\nto be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, the\\nexpectation is that in time Shareholder returns will be acceptable if not substantial.

Our  evaluation  of  the  Directors’\\nassessment of the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included a review\\nof the cash flow forecasts prepared by management, challenging the assumptions made therein and evaluating\\nthe ability of the company to realise its Level 1 investments, if required, to meet its liabilities as they fall due.\\nBased on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or\\nconditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a\\ngoing concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.\\nOur responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the\\nrelevant sections of this report.\\nOur application of materiality\\nThe scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. The quantitative and qualitative thresholds\\nfor materiality determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.\\nMateriality for the company financial statements was set at £184,000 (2021: £422,000). This was calculated based\\non 3% of net assets, of which equity investments comprise the majority of the balance. The basis for calculating\\nmateriality is unchanged from the previous year, with the reduction reflecting the fall in fair value of equity\\ninvestments at year-end. The benchmark used is the one which we determined, in our professional judgment, to\\nbe the key benchmark within the financial statements relevant to shareholders of an investment management\\ncompany in assessing financial performance. The key driver of the company and assessment of its performance\\nis linked to the valuation of its equity investments held. Performance materiality has been set at £128,800 (2021:\\n£295,400) being 70% of headline materiality, based upon our assessment of risk and the absence of any audit\\nadjustments in previous periods.\\nWe agreed to report to those charged with governance all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified\\nthrough our audit with a value in excess of £9,000 (2021: £21,100). We also agreed to report any other audit\\nmisstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.\\n30\\n\", 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued\\nOur approach to the audit\\nIn designing our audit, we determined materiality, and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial\\nstatements. In particular, we looked at areas where the Directors made significant judgements, comprising the fair\\nvalue of investments at level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We also assessed the risk of management override\\nof internal controls.\\nKey audit matters\\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of\\nthe financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material\\nmisstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the\\noverall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.\\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming\\nour opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.\\nKey Audit Matter: How our scope addressed this matter\\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Note 10): The Company holds equity investments with a carrying value of £6m (2021: £14m) as at 30 September 2022. The portfolio consists largely of listed investments, and thus are valued under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Unlisted investments are subject to management valuation, and thus are exposed to significant levels of management judgement and estimation. These investments have been written down to £Nil in previous periods. Based upon the significance of the value of the investments held at the year end, this was determined to be a Key Audit Matter.\\nOur work in this area included:\\n- Reviewing the valuation methodology for each type of investment held and ensuring the carrying values are supported by sufficient and appropriate audit evidence;\\n- Ensuring that investments are categorised and disclosed correctly in accordance with UK GAAP;\\n- Agreeing year-end fair values to independent sources of price data;\\n- Ensuring that the company has legal title to the investments held; and\\n- Performing tests of detail on investment disposals in the year.\\nOther information\\nThe other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements\\nand our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the\\nannual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the\\nextent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our\\nresponsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially\\ninconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise\\nappears  to  be  materially  misstated.  If  we  identify  such  material  inconsistencies  or  apparent  material\\nmisstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial\\nstatements themselves. If, based  on the work we  have performed, we conclude that there  is a material\\nmisstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.\\n31\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Starvest_plc.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Starvest plc', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\nINDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued\\nWe have nothing to report in this regard.\\nOpinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006\\nIn our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:\\n-  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the\\nfinancial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and\\n-  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal\\nrequirements.\\nMatters on which we are required to report by exception\\nIn the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the\\naudit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.\\nWe have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires\\nus to report to you if, in our opinion:\\n-  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received\\nfrom branches not visited by us; or\\n-  the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or\\n-  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or\\n-  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.\\nResponsibilities of directors\\nAs explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the\\npreparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such\\ninternal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are\\nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\\nIn preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue\\nas a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis\\nof accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic\\nalternative but to do so.\\nAuditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements\\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free\\nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.\\nReasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance\\nwith ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.

These Financial Statements (the \"Financial Statements\") have been prepared and approved by\\nthe Directors on 07 February 2023 and signed on their behalf by Mark Badros and Gemma Cryan.\\n2.  Basis of Preparation\\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting\\nstandards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 – ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the\\nUnited Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS102’), and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements\\nhave been prepared on the historical cost basis. There are no fair value adjustments other than to the carrying\\nvalue of the Company’s trade investments. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is\\nalso the functional currency of the company.\\nGoing concern\\nThe Company\\'s day to day financing is from its available cash resources and, on occasion, by the part disposal of\\ninvestments and use of short-term loans.\\nThe Directors are confident that adequate funding can be raised as required to meet the Company\\'s current and\\nfuture liabilities, which has been confirmed within the cash flow forecast prepared by the Board for the 12 months\\nending 29 February 2024. In the unlikely event that such finance could not be raised, the Directors could raise\\nsufficient funds by disposal of certain of its current asset trade investments.\\nAs at the date of this report, the Company has no borrowings.\\nFor the reasons outlined above, the Directors are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its current and\\nfuture liabilities, and continue trading, for the foreseeable future and, in any event, for a period of not less than\\ntwelve months from the date of approving the financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements on\\na going concern basis is therefore considered to remain appropriate.\\n3.

However, the tax on any unrealised profit is calculated and\\nshown in the accounts as if the profit had been realised, but there is then an adjustment in the deferred tax to\\nmove the tax that relates to the unrealised profit to the balance sheet.\\nForeign Currencies\\nTransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.\\nMonetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the\\nexchange rate ruling at the reporting date, unless specifically covered by foreign exchange contracts whereupon\\nthe contract rate is used.\\nInvestments\\nCurrent investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices.\\nInvestments in unlisted company shares are remeasured to available market values, or Directors’ valuations at\\neach balance sheet date.

REVIEW:\\nBrave Bison competes in a growing and exciting marketplace at the intersection of social media, technology, data science and ecommerce.\\nWe operate from trend to spend for our customers; promoting products, selling advertising on our channels and building transactional websites and apps to enable check out. Our vision is to build a company for the new era and the past twelve months have seen us consolidate and integrate across what has become our foundational platform.\\nBrave Bison operates across four business pillars:\\nBrave Bison Performance is a digital media advertising practice. We plan and buy media on platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, Amazon and YouTube. All of our work is focused on helping our customers drive conversion metrics such sales, downloads and subscriptions. Customers include New Balance, Curry's and Asus.\\nBrave Bison Commerce is a digital commerce practice. We provide technology services to help customers design and build next generation ecommerce platforms. Our teams use the latest MACH technology from partners such as Salesforce, Adobe, SAP and BigCommerce to design, launch, upgrade and support best-in-class ecommerce systems. Customers include Viking Direct, MKM Building Supplies and Muller.\\nBrave Bison Social & Influencer (re-branded to Social Chain as of February 2023) is a social media advertising practice. We create content for customers on social media platforms and work with influencers to make and distribute content. This creative approach ensures that content is native to the platform, leading to higher engagements from audiences. Customers include Panasonic, Vodafone, WWF and Rapyd.\\nBrave Bison Media Network is a portfolio of channels across YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. These channels generate over 1 billion monthly views, and the advertising inventory from each channel is sold through online advertising exchanges. Popular channels include The Hook, PGA Tour, US Open and Link Up TV.\\nWhilst each of our business pillars is led by a Managing Director and supported by department heads, the Brave Bison platform is one of connection and collaboration. We have worked hard over the past year to ensure that, despite our four centres of excellence, we operate as one company, with a shared vision that aligns across each of our business pillars.\\n\\n\", 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\nYear in Review:\\n2022 was a strong year for Brave Bison. During the period revenue grew by 46% to almost £32m, gross profit more than doubled to just under £17m and the company generated adjusted EBITDA of over £3m, a YoY increase of 71%. At year end our balance sheet remained strong with net cash of over £6m, after having completed our third acquisition since Theo, Philippa and I joined the company mid 2020.\\n\"We operate from trend to spend for our customers\"\\nDuring the period the Leadership Team maintained a sharp operational focus. We completed the integration of four businesses, made our third acquisition, and relaunched an enhanced value and service proposition under a refreshed Brave Bison brand. This integrated and connected approach has already proven its ability to attract new customers and allow for effective cross selling across our four business units.\\nBest Response Media (BRM) was acquired during the period and integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. Until the acquisition, our efforts at Brave Bison Commerce were focused on three major enterprise ecommerce platforms: SAP, Salesforce and BigCommerce. Through the acquisition of BRM, we are now able to offer services on Adobe Commerce Cloud, a ubiquitous platform that has grown from strength-to-strength in recent years. Furthermore, we acquired a highly experienced and flexible resource base in Mansoura, Egypt, as well as Tier 1 customers including NatWest.\\nBrave Bison is headquartered in London, but the business operates across the world. We have staff in 11 countries and almost a quarter of our team works remotely. Furthermore, over 50% of our staff work on a hybrid basis, often choosing to come into the office between one and three days per week. This new way of working is an important part of our strategy moving forward and is telling of the digital age we are leaning into as a business. Our hybrid and remote workforce enables us to hire more quickly, cheaply and often from a more diverse pool of talent. This approach also means that, as we scale and grow our teams, we can keep property costs low whilst maintaining a strong culture through a mixture of virtual team events and quarterly in person socials.\\nTheo and I are committed to developing Brave Bison\\'s board in a thoughtful and measured way, in line with modern standards of governance. The appointment of Gordon Brough as non-executive director during the period is a further indication of this commitment. Gordon has extensive experience in UK public companies having been General Counsel at Aberdeen Asset Management plc (subsequently the asset management arm of Abrdn) for almost 10 years.

Furthermore, our position in this expanding marketplace is differentiated and growing from strength-to-strength.\\nThis organic growth will be compounded by our carefully considered Acquisition & Integration strategy that has proven successful to date. Our Leadership Team is both capable and focussed, and we anticipate that the acquisition of Social Chain (completed in February 2023) will have a transformative impact on our ability to win and deliver for customers in the social media advertising space.\\nOliver Green\\nExecutive Chairman\\n26 April 2023\\n\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\nCFO'S REVIEW:\\n2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison.\\nRevenue increased by 46% to £31.7 million (2021: £21.7 million), gross profit increased by 117% to £16.9 million (2021: £7.8 million) and adjusted profit before tax, a measure of underlying profitability, increased by 86% to £2.6 million (2021: £1.4 million).\\nOrganic growth of gross profit, removing the impact of businesses acquired during the period, was £1.8 million, or approximately 12%.\\n\\n\", 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\nPrincipal Activities:\\nBrave Bison has two business models.\\nFirstly, the provision of digital advertising and technology services to global blue-chip companies. Services provided include social media advertising, influencer marketing, paid media services, search engine optimisation services, ecommerce software integration, ecommerce system design and others. Customers include New Balance, Muller, Primark and Asus. This operation is referred to as \"fee based services\" in the Group segmental reporting.\\nThe digital advertising and technology services business unit showed good growth during the year. Revenues increased by 169% to £19.7 million (2021: £7.3 million) and the gross profit approximately tripled to £14.0 million (2021: £4.8 million). In line with our acquisition and integration strategy, Greenlight Digital was integrated into Brave Bison Performance, and Greenlight Commerce and Best Response Media were integrated into Brave Bison Commerce.\\nSecondly, Brave Bison owns and operates a network of social and digital media channels. These channels principally exist on platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. Brave Bison publishes content on these channels which attract views and serve advertising which can be bought programmatically through digital advertising platforms. This operation is referred to as \"advertising\" in Group segmental reporting.\\nThe advertising business unit generated revenue of £11.9 million (2021: £14.3 million) and approximately 1.3 billion views (2021: 1.7 billion). This decrease year-on-year largely relates to channels that are operated but not owned by Brave Bison on a revenue share basis, therefore the underlying gross profit remained broadly flat at £2.9 million (2021: £3.0 million). The small drop in gross profit was largely due to a softening of CPMs (cost per mille) in the second half of the year in response to macro-economic conditions. As we saw during the pandemic, this part of our business can be sensitive to such conditions, but tends to recover swiftly.\\n\"2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison\"\\nMargins & Operations\\nBrave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit before tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance indicator to measure the Group\\'s financial performance.\\nThe adjusted profit margin for the period was 15.4% (2021: 17.9%) a decrease year-on-year. This decrease was driven by the tripling of digital advertising and technology services net revenues which operates at a lower adjusted profit margin than advertising generated on the media network.\\nDespite the decrease in adjusted profit margin, Brave Bison has completed a number of initiatives to reduce the underlying operating costs of the business. These include a reduction in property costs through sub-letting excess office space, reduction in IT costs as business units are merged and careful resource management to reduce the staff cost to net revenue ratio for billable customers.\\nExceptional Costs & Adjustments\\nDuring the year Brave Bison incurred restructuring costs of £0.1 million (2021:£0.2 million), relating to the restructuring and expansion of the Group\\'s operations in Bulgaria, and acquisition costs of £0.1 million (2021: £0.7 million) relating to the costs associated with acquiring Best Response Media.\\nBrave Bison carried out a purchase price allocation exercise during the year in relation to the Greenlight acquisitions which completed in 2021, which resulted in identification of intangible assets relating to the acquired brands and customer relationships. As a result of the rebranding, and retirement of the Greenlight trade brand during the year, the amounts relating to this were impaired in full during the year, resulting in an impairment charge of £0.5 million (2021: £nil). The customer relationships are being amortised over a period of 10 years, resulting in a charge of £0.2 million (2021: £nil). As we deliver on our acquisition and integration strategy it is likely that both the amortisation of acquired intangibles, and impairment of acquired brands retired post-integration will continue to impact our financial statements.\\nEquity settled share-based payments relate to the value of share awards that have been granted to employees of the Group. £0.3 million of this amount relates to the directors\\' LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors\\' Remuneration Report. The earliest possible redemption date is December 2024, and redemption is contingent on the share price exceeding 3.0 pence.\\nAdjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that the Group uses to measure its performance and is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions and share based payments. It should be noted that a portion of the property costs in both 2022 and 2021 fall into the finance costs and depreciation lines as a result of the introduction of IFRS 16 \\'Leases\\'.\\nAs a result, the Group also uses Adjusted profit before tax as a measure of performance, which is stated after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions, share based payments, impairments and amortisation of acquired intangibles, but which is after the deduction of costs associated with property leases.\\n: Adjusted EBITDA, 2022 £000\\'s: 3,020, 2021 £000\\'s: 1,762\\n: Finance costs, 2022 £000\\'s: (86), 2021 £000\\'s: (67)\\n: Finance income, 2022 £000\\'s: 80, 2021 £000\\'s: -\\n: Depreciation, 2022 £000\\'s: (382), 2021 £000\\'s: (279)\\n: Adjusted Profit before tax, 2022 £000\\'s: 2,632, 2021 £000\\'s: 1,416\\n: Restructuring costs, 2022 £000\\'s: (62), 2021 £000\\'s: (176)\\n: Acquisition costs, 2022 £000\\'s: (56), 2021 £000\\'s: (686)\\n: Impairment charge, 2022 £000\\'s: (456), 2021 £000\\'s: -\\n: Amortisation of acquired intangibles, 2022 £000\\'s: (215), 2021 £000\\'s: (34)\\n: Equity settled share based payments*, 2022 £000\\'s: (387), 2021 £000\\'s: (62)\\n: Profit before tax, 2022 £000\\'s: 1,456, 2021 £000\\'s: 458\\n*£0.3 million of the equity settled share based payments is a non-cash charge related to the director\\'s LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors\\' Remuneration Report.\\nFinancial Position\\nBrave Bison ended the period with cash resources of £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million) and net cash after deducting outstanding bank loans of £6.2 million (2021: £4.7 million). The bank loan relates to a Government-backed CBIL that is repayable over six years from drawdown.\\nIn addition to the CBIL, Brave Bison has a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank for a total of £3 million, with an interest margin of 2.75% over Base Rate. This was agreed during the period but was undrawn at the period end.\\nThe Group had cash inflow of £0.6 million during the period (2021: £3.2 million inflow), and expects to maintain positive cashflow throughout 2023. The decrease in cash inflow is largely due to a large customer prepayment received at the end of 2021, which subsequently unwound during the period.\\n\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\nIn addition to this, the cashflow generated from operating activities was used to fund the acquisition of Best Response Media (£0.3 million) and the payment of deferred consideration in respect of the Greenlight acquisition made in 2021 (£0.8 million).:\\nThe Group is carrying intangible assets of £6.3 million (2021: £6.3 million).

A lack of skilled workforce could result in a drop in service levels and customer dissatisfaction, and therefore have an adverse impact on the Group in terms of its reputation. The loss of such individuals, or the failure to train and attract other high calibre individuals may impact on the Group's business and the Group's ability to achieve its targets., Mitigating Factors: The Group ensures all its employees are supported and managed by way of regular performance appraisals. Furthermore, the Group incentivises key employees using performance-related bonus plans and share option awards that vest over a multi-year period.\\nRisk: Competitive industry dynamics, Potential Risk Description: The Group operates in a highly complex and rapidly changing industry. If the Group is not able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected., Mitigating Factors: The Board believes the Group has adopted a competitive business strategy to increase the profits of the business. The Group has implemented an acquisitive business model to improve its capabilities and scale within the markets which it operates. Furthermore, the Group maintains a substantial net cash position to provide flexibility in the event of a more competitive and less profitable trading environment.\\nRisk: Dependence on the operating policies of key platforms, Potential Risk Description: The Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue from three international technology platforms which are subject to external factors beyond the Group's control. Changes to the commercial agreements or policies implemented by these platforms could have a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group has diversified its business model away from the advertising platforms, which now only account for 38% (FY21: 66%) of the Group's revenues. Furthermore, the Group has diversified its revenues between three platforms to reduce the impact of any single platform policy change.\\nRisk: Impact of Pandemics, Potential Risk Description: A pandemic could cause an adverse impact on the Group's financial position. Customer marketing budgets could reduce, which may result in lower revenues. The Group's employees may be unable to service customers due to sickness or disruption to the Group's operations., Mitigating Factors: The Group operates a robust hybrid working system where its employees are not normally required to be physically present in an office in order to deliver work for customers.\\nRisk: Foreign Currency Risk, Potential Risk Description: The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange movements in the US dollar. These movements could result in a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposure.

Nevertheless, we continue to aim to reduce our environmental impact.\\nOur sustainability strategy has 3 pillars, emissions, waste & recycling and consumables.\\nCarbon emissions:\\nAs a service business our energy use is by far our biggest contributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity and gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal (non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with simple but effective office measures.\\nThe most important of these is our pledge to offset actual carbon emissions or the highest year of emissions – providing a direct incentive to staff to save energy, since any reduction below our worst year translates into the business being carbon negative. This is critical and, we believe, unique, as it removes the implicit \"permission to emit\" that carbon offsetting programmes can otherwise create.\\nCarbon Emissions are classified as Scope 1, 2 or 3. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, Scope 2 is made up of indirect emissions that a company is directly responsible for, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and emissions from public transport made on company business, and Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that the company is indirectly responsible for. Scope 3 is wide and includes emissions from cloud computing, emissions associated with the manufacture of office equipment and much more.\\nOur Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions are measured in the first half of each year for the prior year. We partner with specialist consultants Carbon Footprint Ltd to assess and verify our footprint. The assessment includes rigorous estimates of the impact of our people working from home, which they now do a significant proportion of the time. From this year we intend our reports will cover the entirety of Scope 3 emissions, making 2022 the first year a complete and unflinching benchmark of our Carbon Footprint has been made.\\nOur offsetting programme is a blend of avoided deforestation (REDD) in the Amazon, reforesting in Africa, UK tree planting, and clean cooking technology in rural China and India (where wood and coal burning is otherwise prevalent). Finally, we plant 15 trees for every new client win or renewed client contract in our Tree Nation forest.\\nAs our measurement to date has been for Scopes 1, 2 and part of Scope 3, we only claim Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality (or carbon negativity in years where our offsetting is greater than our emissions). Following 2022\\'s Carbon Footprint assessment which we expect to be complete by the end of May, it\\'s our ambition to make a Net Zero commitment in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative, accompanied by a plan to reach Net Zero across all scopes.\\nOther measures include automatic timers on our TV\\'s and communication with our staff about the impact their energy use has. Travel was significantly reduced as a result of COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel where possible.\\nWaste & Recycling\\nThe Group operates a largely paperless office. All employees are advised that documents and emails should not be printed, instead accessed via shared digital drives. When required, printers are set to double-sided and black and white, the aim being to reduce the use of both paper and toner.\\nWe have long been a Group that aims to recycle as much waste as possible. We have clearly labelled recycling points stationed around the offices, and avoid bins at desks to encourage their use.\\nConsumables\\nWe have an ongoing programme designed to minimise the environmental impact of our consumption beyond greenhouse gases and recycling.\\nLivestock farming generates a significant percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, with red meat and dairy producing the majority of this. A third of the water used for farming goes toward rearing farm animals. Soy and oat milk alternatives are provided, again reducing our dairy farming impact while avoiding water intensive almond milk. From this year, our ambition is to stop the routine purchase of any meat in food bought for staff and clients, with exceptions only for special events and requests.\\nWe have removed all plastic bottled water from our London office and installed fresh still and sparkling water taps instead, avoiding over 600 single use plastic bottles every month.\\nLastly, we only buy 100% recycled paper for our office printers.\\n\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\nSOCIAL:\\nBrave Bison is committed to developing a diverse workforce, an inclusive culture and the removal of barriers for underrepresented groups.\\n56% of employees are male and 44% of employees are female.

The Group is dependent for its working capital requirements on cash generated from operations, and cash holdings. The cash holdings of the Group at 31 December 2022 were £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million). The Group made a profit before tax of £1.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £0.5 million), and generated an increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of £0.6 million (2021: £3.2 million).

Leasing:\\nFor any new contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. To apply this definition the Group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether:\\n• The contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Group;\\n• The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract;\\n• The Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Group assess whether it has the right to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset is used throughout the period of use.\\nAt lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right‑of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received).\\nThe Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.\\nAt the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate.\\nLease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.\\nSubsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments.\\nWhen the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use is already reduced to zero.\\n\\n\", 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\n4.7.

The rates generally applicable are:\\n• Fixtures & Fittings – 3 years or over remaining lease term\\n• Computer Equipment – 3 years\\nThe gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.\\n\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\nThe assets' residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date.

Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.:\\nIf the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.

This is recognised when the obligation is incurred, either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period of the lease, at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to restore the assets. Estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for new circumstances.:\\n5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty\\nThe preparation of financial statements under UK adopted International Accounting Standards requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.\\n\\n\", 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\n5.1. Critical accounting judgements:\\nIntangible assets and impairment\\nThe Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is determined by experts engaged by management and based upon management's and the Directors' judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore management must estimate the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.\\nTrade receivables' recovery\\nWithin trade debtors there is a balance of £0.7 million (2021: £0.7 million) which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is because it believes it is recoverable, since there is a trade payable balance of £0.8 million (2021: £0.8 million) with the same company, and the Group is anticipating reaching agreement that these balances may be set off against each other.\\nTreatment of revenue as agent or principal\\n\\n\", 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\nThe determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. These include if the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service, if the Group has inventory risk before the good or services has been transferred to the customer and if the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the good or service.:\\nDeferred taxation\\nDeferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.\\nGreenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation\\nThe purchase price allocation of the Greenlight acquisition was fully assessed in the year, within the one year IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, and acquired intangibles were identified and a full valuation exercise carried out in relation to the Greenlight trade name and the customer relationships. The purchase price has been reallocated accordingly.\\nBest Response Media acquisition and purchase price allocation\\nThe purchase price allocation of the Best Response Media acquisition was provisionally assessed, and the Group judged that at the interim valuation stage it was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. A full valuation exercise will be completed within the one year IFRS3 measurement period from the date of acquisition which may recognise additional intangible assets separately from goodwill.\\n\\n', 'question': 'Нет вопроса', 'answer': 'Нет ответа', 'source': 'Brave_Bison.txt', 'topic': -2, 'topic_name': 'Brave Bison', 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\n5.2. Estimates:\\nShare based payment charges\\nThe Group is required to measure the fair value of its share based payments. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes method which requires assumptions regarding exchange rate volatility, the risk free rate, share price volatility and the expected life of the share based payment. Exchange rate volatility is calculated using historic data over the past three years. The volatility of the Group's share price has been calculated as the average of similar listed companies over the preceding periods. The risk-free rate range used is between 0% and 1.25% and management, including the Directors, have estimated the expected life of most share based payments to be 4 years.\\nBad debt provision\\nRecoverability of some receivables may be doubtful although not definitely irrecoverable. Where management feel recoverability is in doubt an appropriate provision is made for the possibility that the amounts may not be recovered in full. Provisions are made using past experience however subjectivity is involved when assessing the level of provision required.\\n6 Segment Reporting\\nGeographic reporting\\nThe Group has identified three geographic areas (United Kingdom & Europe, Asia Pacific and Rest of the world) and the information is presented based on the customers' location.\\n: Revenue, 2022 £000's: , 2021 £000's:\\n: United Kingdom & Europe, 2022 £000's: 28,493, 2021 £000's: 17,548\\n: Asia Pacific, 2022 £000's: 311, 2021 £000's: 894\\n: Rest of the world, 2022 £000's: 2,848, 2021 £000's: 3,218\\n: Total revenue, 2022 £000's: 31,652, 2021 £000's: 21,660\\nThe Group identifies two revenue streams, advertising and fee based services, which correspond to the Media Network and Digital Advertising and Technology Services pillars respectively.

The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows:\\nForeign currency risk\\nTransactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of services from the UK to overseas clients, and from the import of services directly sourced from overseas suppliers. The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange in relation to movements in sterling against the US Dollar, the Euro and the Singapore Dollar.\\nThe Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposures.

This grouping is determined based on the lowest level of significant inputs used in fair value measurement, as follows:\\n• level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;\\n• level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and\\n• level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).\\nThe Group categorises all financial assets and liabilities as level 1.\\nMaturity analysis\\nSet out below is a maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities.

The consideration was financed by existing cash balances. Best Response Media Limited is a specialist ecommerce and mobile development company focused exclusively on the Adobe Commerce Platform.\\nThe provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:\\n: Goodwill, Book value £000's: 239, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 239\\n: Tangible Assets, Book value £000's: 1, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1\\n: Trade and other receivables, Book value £000's: 237, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 237\\n: Cash and cash equivalents, Book value £000's: 840, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 840\\n: Current Liabilities, Book value £000's: (143), Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: (143)\\n: , Book value £000's: 1,174, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1,174\\nThe consideration for the acquisition was as follows:\\n: Initial cash consideration – paid, £000's: 962\\n: Completion accounts adjustment – paid, £000's: 37\\n: Deferred cash consideration – paid, £000's: 175\\n: , £000's: 1,174\\nThe consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes £0.1 million of acquisition costs in relation to Best Response Media Limited.\\nThe fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of £0.2 million and a gross contractual value of £0.3 million. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.1 million. The goodwill represents the acquired accumulated workforce and the synergies expected from integrating Best Response Media into the Group's existing business. The Group has carried out an interim fair value adjustment exercise and will be completing a full exercise within the one year measurement period from the date of the acquisition in accordance with IFRS3. At the interim valuation stage the Group has not been able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other identifiable assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. Once the full valuation exercise has been completed additional intangible assets may be recognised separately from goodwill.\\nBest Response Media Limited contributed £0.5 million revenue and £0.2 million loss to the Group's profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the reporting date.\\nIf the acquisition of Best Response Media Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been £32 million and Group profit would have been £1.9 million.\\n30 Post balance sheet events\\nOn the 3 February 2023 the Group announced the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital of Social Chain Limited. The initial consideration for the acquisition consisted of a payment of £7.7m. This was partially funded by way of an oversubscribed vendor placing to raise £4.75 million. Social Chain is one of the UK's leading social media and influencer marketing agencies. The completion balance sheet in relation to the acquisition is still being prepared, and therefore a breakdown of the assets and liabilities acquired has not been disclosed.\\n\\n\", 'question': 'Нет
