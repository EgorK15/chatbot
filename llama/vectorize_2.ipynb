The framework aligns executive reward with the achievement of strategic objectives and the creation of value for shareholders, and it is considered to conform to the market best practice for the delivery of reward. The Board of Directors ('the Board') ensures that executive reward satisfies the following key criteria for good reward governance practices:\\ncompetitiveness and reasonableness;\\nacceptability to shareholders;\\nperformance linkage/alignment of executive compensation; and\\ntransparency.\\n\\nThe Board is responsible for determining and reviewing remuneration arrangements for its directors and executives. The performance of the consolidated entity depends on the quality of its directors and executives. The remuneration philosophy is to attract, motivate and retain high-performance and high-quality personnel.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nThe reward framework is designed to align executive reward to shareholders' interests. The Board has considered that it should seek to enhance shareholders' interests by:\\nhaving economic profit as a core component of plan design;\\nfocusing on sustained growth in shareholder wealth, consisting of dividends and growth in share price, and delivering \\nconstant or increasing return on assets as well as focusing the executive on key non-financial drivers of value; and\\nattracting and retaining high calibre executives.\\n\\nAdditionally, the reward framework should seek to enhance executives' interests by:\\nrewarding capability and experience\\nreflecting competitive reward for contribution to growth in shareholder wealth\\nproviding a clear structure for earning rewards\\n\\nIn accordance with best practice corporate governance, the remuneration structure of non-executive director and executive director is separate.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Non-executive directors' remuneration\\nThe Board's policy is to remunerate non-executive directors at market rates for comparable companies for time, commitment and responsibilities. The Board determines payments to the non- executive directors and reviews their remuneration annually, based on market practice, duties and accountability. Independent external advice is sought when required. The maximum aggregate amount of fees that can be paid to non-executive directors is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. Fees for non-executive directors are not linked to the performance of the consolidated entity.\\n\\nASX listing rules require the aggregate non-executive directors' remuneration to be determined periodically by a general meeting. The most recent determination was at the Annual General Meeting held on 25 January 2022, where the shareholders approved a maximum annual aggregate remuneration of $32,760.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Executive remuneration\\nThe consolidated entity aims to reward executives based on their position and responsibility, with a level and mix of remuneration which has both fixed and variable components.\\n\\nThe executive remuneration and reward framework has four components:\\nbase pay and non-monetary benefits;\\nshort-term performance incentives;\\nshare-based payments; and\\nother remuneration such as superannuation and long service leave.\\n\\nThe combination of these comprises the executive's total remuneration. Fixed remuneration, consisting of base salary, superannuation and non-monetary benefits, is reviewed annually by the Board \\nbased on individual and business unit performance, the overall performance of the consolidated entity and comparable market remunerations.\\n\\nExecutives may receive their fixed remuneration in the form of cash or other fringe benefits (for example motor vehicle benefits), which does not create any additional costs to the consolidated entity and provides additional value to the executive.\\n\\nThe short-term incentives ('STI') program is designed to align the targets of the business units with the performance hurdles of executives. STI payments are granted to executives based on specific annual targets and key performance indicators ('KPI's') being achieved. KPI's include profit contribution, customer satisfaction, leadership contribution and product management.\\n\\nThe long-term incentives ('LTI') include long service leave and share-based payments. Shares are awarded to executives in accordance with performance guidelines established by the Board. These include increase in shareholders' value relative to the entire market and the increase compared to the consolidated entity's direct competitors. The Board reviewed the long-term equity-linked performance incentives specifically for executives during the year ended 30 June 2022.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Consolidated entity performance and link to remuneration\\nAs part of each executive director and executive’s remuneration package there may be a performance-based component, consisting of key performance indicators (KPI’s). The intention of this program is to facilitate goal congruence between directors/executives with that of the business and shareholders. Where applicable, the KPI’s are set annually, with a certain level of consultation with directors/executives to ensure buy-in. The measures are specifically tailored to the areas each director/executive is involved in and has a level of control over. The KPI’s target areas the Board believes hold greater potential for the consolidated entity expansion and profit, covering financial and non-financial as well as short-term and long-term goals. The level set for each KPI is based on budgeted figures for the consolidated entity and respective industry standards.\\n\\nPerformance in relation to the KPI’s is assessed annually, with bonuses being awarded depending on the number and deemed difficulty of the KPI’s achieved. Following the assessment, the KPI’s are reviewed by the Board in light of the desired and actual outcomes, and their efficiency is assessed in relation to the consolidated entity’s goals and shareholder wealth before the KPI’s are set for the following year.\\n\\nIn determining whether or not a KPI has been achieved, Rectifier Technologies Ltd bases the assessment on audited figures; however, where the KPI involves comparison of individual performance within the consolidated entity, management reports which form the foundation for the consolidated entity audited results are used.\\n\\nRefer to the section 'Additional information' below for details of the earnings and total shareholders return for the last five years.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Use of remuneration consultants\\nDuring the financial year ended 30 June 2022, the consolidated entity, did not engage any remuneration consultants.\\n\\nVoting and comments made at the Company's 30 June 2021 Annual General Meeting ('AGM')\\nAt the 25 January 2022 AGM, 99.77% of the votes received supported the adoption of the remuneration report for the year ended 30 June 2021. The Company did not receive any specific feedback at the AGM regarding its remuneration practices.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n# Details of remuneration\\n\\n## Amounts of remuneration\\nDetails of the

General information\\nThe financial statements cover Rectifier Technologies Ltd as a consolidated entity consisting of Rectifier Technologies Ltd and the entities it controlled at the end of, or during, the year. The financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Rectifier Technologies Ltd's functional and presentation currency. Rectifier Technologies Ltd is a listed public company limited by shares, incorporated and domiciled in Australia. Its registered office and principal place of business is: 97 Highbury Road, Burwood, VIC 3125. A description of the nature of the consolidated entity's operations and its principal activities are included in the directors' report, which is not part of the financial statements. The financial statements were authorised for issue, in accordance with a resolution of directors, on 30 September 2022. The directors have the power to amend and reissue the financial statements.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n# Note 2. Significant accounting policies\\nThe principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation of the financial statements are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## New or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations adopted\\nThe consolidated entity has adopted all of the new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') that are mandatory for the current reporting period. Any new or amended Accounting Standards or Interpretations that are not yet mandatory have not been early adopted.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Going concern\\nThe financial report has been prepared on the basis of the Group continuing as a going concern, which assumes continuity of normal business activities and realisation of assets and the settlement of liabilities in the ordinary course of business.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Basis of preparation\\nThese general purpose financial statements have been prepared  in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards and Interpretations issued by the Australian Accounting Standards Board ('AASB') and the Corporations Act 2001, as appropriate for for-profit oriented entities. These financial statements also comply with International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ('IASB').\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Historical cost convention\\nThe financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Critical accounting estimates\\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the consolidated entity's accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or complexity, or areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the financial statements, are disclosed in note 3.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Parent entity information\\nIn accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, these financial statements present the results of the consolidated entity only. Supplementary information about the parent entity is disclosed in note 33.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Principles of consolidation\\nThe consolidated financial statements incorporate the assets and li abilities of all subsidiaries of Rectifier Technologies Ltd ('Company' or 'parent entity') as at 30 June 2022 and the results of all subsidiaries for the year ended. Rectifier Technologies Ltd and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the 'consolidated entity'. Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the consolidated entity has control. The consolidated entity controls an entity when the consolidated entity is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the consolidated entity. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the consolidated entity are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the consolidated entity. The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration \\ntransferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent. Where the consolidated entity loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The consolidated entity recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Operating segments\\nOperating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM'). The CODM is responsible for the allocation of resources to operating segments and assessing their performance.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Foreign currency translation\\nThe financial statements are presented in Australian dollars, which is Rectifier Technologies Ltd's functional and presentation currency. Foreign currency transactions are translated into the entity’s functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from \\nthe translation at financial year-end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in profit or loss. The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions for the period. All resulting foreign exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income through the foreign currency reserve in equity. The foreign currency reserve is recognised in profit or loss when the foreign operation or net investment is disposed of.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Revenue recognition\\nThe consolidated entity recognises revenue as follows: revenue from contracts with customers, sale of goods, other revenue, and interest.\\nRevenue from contracts with customers is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration to which the consolidated entity is expected to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. For each contract with a customer, the consolidated entity: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative  stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised. Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely  amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability. Sale of goods or revenue from the sale of power rectifiers and the related after-sales services is recognised at the point in time when the consolidated entity satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised products and services, which is generally at the time of delivery. The consolidated entity recognises contract liabilities for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations and reports these amounts as other liabilities in the statement of financial position. Similarly, if the consolidated entity satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the consideration, the consolidated entity recognises either a contract asset or a receivable in its statement of financial position, depending on whether something other than the passage of time is required before the consideration is due. Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established. Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrued using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest in come over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Income tax\\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for: (1) when the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or (2) when the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different tax able entities which intend to settle simultaneously. Rectifier Technologies Ltd (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group. In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group. Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n## Current and non-current classification\\nAssets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification. An asset is classified as current when: it is either expected to be realised or intended to be sold or consumed in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is expected to be realised within 12 months after the reporting period, or the asset is cash or cash equivalent unless restricted from being exchanged or used to settle a liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other assets are classified as non-current. A liability is classified as current when: it is either expected to be settled in the consolidated entity's normal operating cycle; it is held primarily for the purpose of trading; it is due to  be settled within 12 months after the reporting period, or there is no unconditional right to defer the settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the reporting period. All other liabilities are classified as non-current. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are always classified as non-current.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Cash and cash equivalents\\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Trade and other receivables\\nTrade receivables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any allowance for expected credit losses. Trade receivables are generally due for settlement within 30 days. The consolidated entity has applied the simplified approach to measuring expected credit losses, which uses a lifetime expected loss allowance. To measure the expected credit losses, trade receivables have been grouped based on days overdue. Other receivables are recognised at amortised cost, less any allowance for expected credit losses.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Inventories\\nRaw materials, work in progress and finished goods are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value on a 'weighted average' basis. Cost comprises of direct materials and deliver y costs, direct labour, import duties and other taxes, an appropriate proportion of variable and fixed overhead expenditure based on normal operating capacity, and, where applicable, transfers from cash flow hedging reserves in equity. Costs of purchased inventory are determined after deducting rebates and discounts received or receivable. Stock in transit is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises of purchase and delivery costs, net of rebates and discounts received or receivable. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Property, plant and equipment\\nFreehold land is stated at historical cost and is not depreciated but is subject to impairment testing if there is any indication of impairment. Building and plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items.\\nDepreciation is calculated on a straight-line basis to write off the net cost of each item of property, plant and equipment (excluding land) over their expected useful lives as follows:\\n- Building: 50 years\\n- Leasehold improvement: 10 years\\n- Plant and equipment: 2.5–5 years\\n- Motor vehicle: 5 years\\nThe residual values, useful lives and depreciation methods are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each reporting date. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the assets, whichever is shorter. An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when there is no future economic benefit to the consolidated entity. Gains and losses between the carrying amount and the disposal proceeds are taken to profit or loss.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Right-of-use assets\\nA right-of-use asset is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which comprises the initial amount of the lease liability, adjusted for, as applicable, any lease payments made at or before the commencement date net of any lease incentives received, any initial direct costs incurred, and, except where included in the cost of inventories, an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset, and restoring the site or asset. Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset, whichever is shorter. Where the consolidated entity expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term, the depreciation is over its estimated useful life. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.\\nThe consolidated entity has elected not to recognise a right-of-use asset and corresponding lease liability for short-term leases with terms of 12 months or less and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these assets are expensed to profit or loss as incurred.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Intangible assets. Research and development\\nResearch costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Development costs are capitalised when: it is probable that the project will be a success considering its commercial and technical feasibility; the consolidated entity is able to use or sell the asset; the consolidated entity has sufficient resources and intent to complete the development; and its costs can \\nbe measured reliably. Capitalised development costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, being their finite life of 10 years.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Impairment of non-financial assets\\nNon-financial assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset's carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use. The value-in-use is the present value of the estimated future cash flows relating to the asset using a pre-tax discount rate specific to the asset or cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Assets that do not have independent cash flows are grouped together to form a cash-generating unit.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Trade and other payables\\nTrade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the consolidated entity prior to the end of the financial year and which are unpaid. Due to their short-term nature, they are measured at amortised cost and are not discounted. The amounts are unsecured and are usually paid within 30 days of recognition.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Borrowings\\nLoans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received, net of transaction costs. They are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Lease liabilities\\nA lease liability is recognised at the commencement date of a lease. The lease liability is initially recognised at the present value of the lease payments to be made over the term of the lease,  discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease or, if that rate cannot be readily determined, the consolidated entity's incremental borrowing rate. Lease payments comprise of fixed payments less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option when the exercise of the option is reasonably certain to occur, and any anticipated termination penal ties. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. The carrying amounts are remeasured if there is a change in the following: future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate used; residual guarantee; lease term; the certainty of a purchase option and termination penalties. When a lease liability is remeasured, an adjustment is made to the corresponding right-of use asset, or to profit or loss if the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset is fully written down.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Finance costs\\nFinance costs attributable to qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the asset. All other finance costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Employee benefits\\nFor short-term employee benefits Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave and long service leave expected to be settled wholly within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the liabilities are settled. Other long-term employee benefits: the liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, the experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Defined contribution superannuation expense: contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Share-based payments: equity-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees, equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services. The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the consolidated entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions. The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an  expense with a corresponding increase in equity at the vesting date which is at the grant date. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods. If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification. If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the consolidated entity or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the consolidated entity or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited. If equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Issued capital\\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Dividends\\nDividends are recognised when declared during the financial year and no longer at the discretion of the Company.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Earnings per share\\nBasic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to the owners of Rectifier Technologies Ltd, excluding any costs of servicing equity other than ordinary shares, by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year, adjusted for bonus elements in ordinary shares issued during the financial year. Diluted earnings per share adjusts the figures used in the determination of basic earnings per share to take into account the after income tax effect of interest and other financing costs associated with dilutive potential ordinary shares and the weighted average number of additional ordinary shares that would have been outstanding assuming conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Goods and Services Tax ('GST') and other similar taxes\\nRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred are not recoverable from the tax authority. In this case, it is recognised as part of the cost of the acquisition of the asset or as part of the expense. Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority is included in other receivables or other payables in the statement of financial position. Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing or financing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the tax authority, are presented as operating cash flows. Commitments and contingencies are disclosed net of the amount of GST recoverable from, or payable to, the tax authority.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## New Accounting Standards and Interpretations not yet mandatory or early adopted\\nAustralian Accounting Standards and Interpretations that have recently been issued or amended but are not yet mandatory, have not been early adopted by the consolidated entity for the annual reporting period ended 30 June 2022. The consolidated entity has not yet assessed the impact of these new or amended Accounting Standards and Interpretations.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n# Note 3. Critical accounting judgements, estimates and assumptions\\nThe preparation of the financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements. Management continually evaluates its judgements and estimates in relation to assets, liabilities, contingent liabilities, revenue  and expenses. Management bases its judgements, estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on other various fact ors, including expectations of future events, management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. The resulting accounting judgements and estimates will seldom equal the related actual results. The judgements, estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities (refer to the respective notes) within the next financial year are discussed below.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Provision for impairment of inventories\\nThe provision for impairment of inventories assessment requires a degree of estimation and judgement. The level of the provision is assessed by taking into account the recent sales experience, the ageing of inventories and other factors that affect inventory obsolescence.\\n\\n', '\\n\\n## R & D tax rebate\\nThe consolidated entity has recognised the R&D rebate on an accrual basis. As the return has not yet been submitted, the consolidated entity has made an estimate of the likely refund amount based on the preliminary number provided by external tax consultant.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Income tax\\nThe consolidated entity is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for income tax. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The consolidated entity recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on the consolidated entity's current understanding of the tax law. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the carrying amounts, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\n# Note 4. Operating segments\\n## Identification of reportable operating segments\\nThe consolidated entity is organised into 4 operating segments as described below. These operating segments are based on the internal reports that are reviewed and used by the executive management committee (who are identified as the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM')) in assessing performance and in determining the allocation of resources. The executive management committee considers the business from both a product and geographic perspective and assesses performance and allocates resources on this basis. There is no aggregation of operating segments.\\n\\nBusiness Segments:\\n\\nElectronic Components:\\nUnder this segment, Rectifier Technologies Pacific Pty Ltd and Rectifier Technologies Malaysia Sdn Bhd, which is based in Malaysia, manufacture electronic components for a number of industries.\\n\\nIndustrial Power Supplies (E&D):\\nUnder this segment, Rectifier Technologies Pacific Pty Ltd and Rectifier Technologies Malaysia Sdn Bhd manufacture and distribute rectifiers, controllers, accessories, and complete systems for the power generation, distribution industries, and defence. Rectifier Technologies Singapore Pte Ltd only focuses on distribution.\\n\\nIndustrial Power Supplies (T&T):\\nUnder this segment, Rectifier Technologies Pacific Pty Ltd and Rectifier Technologies Malaysia Sdn Bhd manufacture and distribute power supplies for the transport industries and telecommunications. Rectifier Technologies Singapore Pte Ltd only focuses on distribution.\\n\\nIndustrial Power Supplies (EV):\\nUnder this segment, Rectifier Technologies Pacific Pty Ltd, Rectifier Technologies Singapore Pte Ltd, and Rectifier Technologies Malaysia Sdn Bhd manufacture and distribute electric vehicle chargers, battery chargers, and power supplies for a number of industries. Rectifier Technologies Singapore Pte Ltd only focuses on distribution.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nThe CODM reviews earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA'). This measure excludes non-recurring expenditures such as restructuring costs, impairments and share-based payments as well as interest revenue and interest expense and other items which are considered part of the corporate treasury function. The accounting policies adopted for internal reporting to the CODM are consistent with those adopted in  the financial statements. The information reported to the CODM is on a monthly basis. Refer to note 5 for geographic information.\\n## Intersegment transactions\\nIntersegment transactions were made at market rates. Inter-segment revenue comprises sales between segments which are on arm's length terms. Intersegment transactions are eliminated on consolidation.\\n## Intersegment receivables, payables and loans\\nIntersegment loans are initially recognised at the consideration received. Intersegment loans receivable and loans payable that earn or incur non-market interest are not adjusted to fair value based on market interest rates. Intersegment loans are eliminated on consolidation.\\n## Major customers\\nDuring the year ended 30 June 2022, the revenue of $10,562,830 (2021: $6,513,519) and $944,754 (2021: $1,164,100) were derived from two Australian customers, which are allocated to the Industrial Power Supplies (EV) and Industrial Power Supplies (E&D) segments respectively. Revenue of $1,482,138 (2021: $1,301,035) was derived from a single (2021: single) customer in Singapore under the Industrial Power Supplies (E&D) segment.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\nOperating segment information -

In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the consolidated entity may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The consolidated entity would look to raise capital when an opportunity to invest in a business or company was seen as value-adding relative to the current Company's share price at the time of the investment. The consolidated entity is not actively pursuing additional investments in the short term as it continues to integrate and grow its existing businesses in order to maximise synergies. The consolidated entity is subject to certain financing arrangements covenants and meeting these is given priority in all capital risk management decisions.

The Board receives monthly reports from the Chief Financial Officer through which it reviews the effectiveness of the processes put in place and the appropriateness of the objectives and policies it sets. The overall objective of the Board is to set policies that seek to reduce risk as far as possible without unduly affecting the \\nconsolidated entity’s competitiveness and flexibility.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Market risk: foreign currency risk\\nThe consolidated entity undertakes certain transactions denominated in foreign currency and is exposed to foreign currency risk through foreign exchange rate fluctuations. The only currency where receivables are not denominated in their functional currency is US dollars (USD). Cash balances in USD are kept at levels only sufficient to pay the amounts owing. Since the local sales in Malaysia are made by foreign operations in their individual functional currencies, there is no direct foreign currency risk exposure involved. The consolidated entity’s exposure to foreign currency risk is primarily its exposure to trade receivables denominated in USD. The carrying amount of the consolidated entity's foreign currency denominated financial assets and financial liabilities at the reporting date were as follows:\\n\\nForeign currency exposure (Consolidated, US Dollars):\\n\\nAssets:\\n- 2022: AUD 532,730\\n- 2021: AUD 328,330\\n\\nLiabilities:\\n- 2022: AUD 651,586\\n- 2021: AUD 177,173\\n\\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis (Consolidated – 2022):\\n\\nIf AUD strengthened by 10%:\\n- Change in assets: AUD 70,300\\n- Change in liabilities: AUD 85,985\\n- Total impact: AUD 156,285\\n\\nIf AUD weakened by 10%:\\n- Change in assets: AUD (85,923)\\n- Change in liabilities: AUD (105,093)\\n- Total impact: AUD (191,016)\\n\\nForeign currency sensitivity analysis (Consolidated – 2021):\\n\\nIf AUD strengthened by 10%:\\n- Change in assets: AUD 39,702\\n- Change in liabilities: AUD 21,424\\n- Total impact: AUD 61,126\\n\\nIf AUD weakened by 10%:\\n- Change in assets: AUD (48,525)\\n- Change in liabilities: AUD (26,185)\\n- Total impact: AUD (74,710)\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Price risk\\nThe consolidated entity is not exposed to any significant price risk.\\n\\n', \"\\n\\n## Interest rate risk\\nThe consolidated entity’s exposure to interest rate risk is limited to cash balances, as these are at a floating rate. Cash balances that are held at call for day to day activities are non-interest bearing. An analysis of remaining contractual maturities is shown in 'liquidity and interest rate risk management' below.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Credit risk\\nCredit risk arises principally from the consolidated entity’s trade receivables. It is the risk that the counterparty fails to discharge its obligation in respect of the instrument.\\nPrior to accepting new customers, a credit check is obtained from a reputable external source. Based on this information, credit limits and payment terms are established. Customers who subsequently fail to meet their credit terms are required to make purchases on a prepayment basis until creditworthiness can be re-established.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. (1) Key Audit Matter: Recognition of R&D Tax Incentive (Note 6 and Note 10) The Group receives a corporate tax rate plus 18.5% (43.5%) refundable tax offset of eligible expenditure under the research and development (“R&D”) scheme if its turnover is less than $20 million per annum, provided it is not controlled by income tax-exempt entities. A registration of R&D activities is filed with AusIndustry in the following financial year, and based on this filing, the group receives the incentive in cash. The Group engaged an R&D expert to perform a detailed review of the Group’s total R&D expenditure to determine the potential claim under the R&D tax incentive legislation. As at 30 June 2022, a receivable totaling $1,035,645 has been recorded. This represents the estimated claim for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This is a key audit matter due to the size of the receivable. The degree of judgement and interpretation of the R&D tax legislation required by management to assess the eligibility of the R&D expenditure under the scheme. (2) How Our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter? Our procedures included, amongst others: Obtaining and documenting through discussions with management an understanding of the process to estimate the claim, Evaluating the competence, capabilities and objectivity of management’s expert, Reviewing and testing the R&D estimate by: reviewing the methodology used by management’s expert for consistency with the R&D tax offset rules, performing testing on a sample of R&D expenses to supporting documents to assess eligibility and accuracy of the amounts recorded in the general ledger, considering the nature of expenses against the eligibility criteria of the R&D tax incentive scheme to assess whether the expense included in the estimate are likely to meet the eligibility criteria. Comparing the nature of the R&D expenditure included in the current year to the prior year’s claim, Comparing the eligible expenditure used in the receivable calculation to expenditure recorded in the general ledger, Considering the entity’s history of successful claims, Inspecting copies of relevant correspondence with AusIndustry and the Australian Taxation Office related to the claims and Assessing the adequacy of the relevant disclosures in the financial statements.     \\n\\n', \"\\n\\nKey Audit Matter: Inventory valuation (Note 11). As at 30 June 2022, the Group holds inventory with a carrying value of $5,877,879. The Group is required to carry their inventory at the lower of cost or net realisable value, in accordance with AASB 102 Inventories. Determining the value of inventory requires significant judgement. Specifically, estimating inventory provisions involves significant management judgement, including predictions about market conditions, future sales, and obsolescence. This is a key audit matter due to the materiality of the inventory balance and the level of management judgement required to determine the inventory value. How our audit addressed the key audit matter? Our procedures included, amongst others: Understanding and documenting management's process of calculating the inventory provision and evaluating the Group’s compliance with therequirements of AASB 102, Testing a sample of inventory items to assess the cost basis and net realisable value of inventories, Analysing slow-moving inventory and evaluating their saleability and obsolescence, Considering additional factors that may indicate inventory items require an adjustment to their carrying amount, including discontinued lines and Assessing the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements.\\n\\n\", \"\\n\\nKey Audit Matter: Revenue recognition (Note 5). Revenue recorded from the sale of products and services to customers amounted to $14,761,523 for the year ended 30 June 2022. The Group enters into transactions for the sale of power rectifiers. The total transaction price for a contract is based on their relative stand-alone selling price. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the Group satisfies the performance obligations, which is generally at the point of delivery. This is a key audit matter given the judgement applied to determine the appropriate recognition of revenue and the material nature of revenue to the Group’s overall performance. How our audit addressed the key audit matter? Our procedures included, amongst others: Reviewing revenue recognition policies for appropriateness in accordance with AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Testing a sample of revenue transactions during the year and assessing whether revenue has been recognised in accordance with AASB 15, including:  (1) Reviewing the relevant contracts with customers, (2) Assessing management's determination of performance obligations within contracts and the allocation of the transaction price to those obligations, (3) Testing the timing of revenue recognition. Evaluating sales transactions around reporting date to assess whether revenue is recognised in the correct period, Performing non-substantive analytical procedures to assess revenue recognised against known business factors and investigating variances to our expectations and Assessing the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.\\n\\n\", '\\n\\n## Information other than the financial report and auditor’s report thereon: the Directors are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the information included in the Group’s annual report for the year ended 30 June 2022, but does not include the financial report and our auditor’s report thereon. Our opinion on the financial report does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial report, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial report or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

In preparing the financial report, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. \\n\\n', '\\n\\n## Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial report\\n Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial report as a whole is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of this financial report. A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial report is located at the Auditing and Assurance Standards Board website at: https://www.auasb.gov.au/auditors_responsibilites/ar1_2020.pdf.

Rectifier Technologies Ltd and its subsidiaries together are referred to in these financial statements as the 'consolidated entity'. Subsidiaries are all those entities over which the consolidated entity has control. The consolidated entity controls an entity when the consolidated entity is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power to direct the activities of the entity. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the consolidated entity. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. Intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between entities in the consolidated entity are eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of the impairment of the asset transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have been changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the policies adopted by the consolidated entity. The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. A change in ownership interest, without the loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction, where the difference between the consideration \\ntransferred and the book value of the share of the non-controlling interest acquired is recognised directly in equity attributable to the parent. Where the consolidated entity loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the assets including goodwill, liabilities and non-controlling interest in the subsidiary together with any cumulative translation differences recognised in equity. The consolidated entity recognises the fair value of the consideration received and the fair value of any investment retained together with any gain or loss in profit or loss.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': 1.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\n## Operating segments\\nOperating segments are presented using the 'management approach', where the information presented is on the same basis as the internal reports provided to the Chief Operating Decision Makers ('CODM').

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the exchange rates at the reporting date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated into Australian dollars using the average exchange rates, which approximate the rates at the dates of the transactions for the period.

For each contract with a customer, the consolidated entity: identifies the contract with a customer; identifies the performance obligations in the contract; determines the transaction price which takes into account estimates of variable consideration and the time value of money; allocates the transaction price to the separate performance obligations on the basis of the relative  stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service to be delivered; and recognises revenue when or as each performance obligation is satisfied in a manner that depicts the transfer to the customer of the goods or services promised. Variable consideration within the transaction price, if any, reflects concessions provided to the customer such as discounts, rebates and refunds, any potential bonuses receivable from the customer and any other contingent events. Such estimates are determined using either the 'expected value' or 'most likely  amount' method. The measurement of variable consideration is subject to a constraining principle whereby revenue will only be recognised to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur. The measurement constraint continues until the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Amounts received that are subject to the constraining principle are recognised as a refund liability. Sale of goods or revenue from the sale of power rectifiers and the related after-sales services is recognised at the point in time when the consolidated entity satisfies performance obligations by transferring the promised products and services, which is generally at the time of delivery. The consolidated entity recognises contract liabilities for consideration received in respect of unsatisfied performance obligations and reports these amounts as other liabilities in the statement of financial position. Similarly, if the consolidated entity satisfies a performance obligation before it receives the consideration, the consolidated entity recognises either a contract asset or a receivable in its statement of financial position, depending on whether something other than the passage of time is required before the consideration is due. Other revenue is recognised when it is received or when the right to receive payment is established. Interest revenue is recognised as interest accrued using the effective interest method. This is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset and allocating the interest in come over the relevant period using the effective interest rate, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the net carrying amount of the financial asset.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': 4.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\n## Income tax\\nThe income tax expense or benefit for the period is the tax payable on that period's taxable income based on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by the changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities attributable to temporary differences, unused tax losses and the adjustment recognised for prior periods, where applicable. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognised for temporary differences at the tax rates expected to be applied when the assets are recovered or liabilities are settled, based on those tax rates that are enacted or substantively enacted, except for: (1) when the deferred income tax asset or liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and that, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting nor taxable profits; or (2) when the taxable temporary difference is associated with interests in subsidiaries, associates or joint ventures, and the timing of the reversal can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it is probable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses. The carrying amount of recognised and unrecognised deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. Deferred tax assets recognised are reduced to the extent that it is no longer  probable that future taxable profits will be available for the carrying amount to be recovered. Previously unrecognised deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there are future taxable profits available to recover the asset. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and deferred tax assets against deferred tax liabilities; and they relate to the same taxable authority on either the same taxable entity or different tax able entities which intend to settle simultaneously. Rectifier Technologies Ltd (the 'head entity') and its wholly-owned Australian subsidiaries have formed an income tax consolidated group under the tax consolidation regime. The head entity and each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group continue to account for their own current and deferred tax amounts. The tax consolidated group has applied the 'separate taxpayer within group' approach in determining the appropriate amount of taxes to allocate to members of the tax consolidated group. In addition to its own current and deferred tax amounts, the head entity also recognises the current tax liabilities (or assets) and the deferred tax assets arising from unused tax losses and unused tax credits assumed from each subsidiary in the tax consolidated group. Assets or liabilities arising under tax funding agreements with the tax consolidated entities are recognised as amounts receivable from or payable to other entities in the tax consolidated group. The tax funding arrangement ensures that the intercompany charge equals the current tax liability or benefit of each tax consolidated group member, resulting in neither a contribution by the head entity to the subsidiaries nor a distribution by the subsidiaries to the head entity.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': 4.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\n## Current and non-current classification\\nAssets and liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position based on current and non-current classification.

Other long-term employee benefits: the liability for annual leave and long service leave not expected to be settled within 12 months of the reporting date are measured at the present value of expected future payments to be made in respect of services provided by employees up to the reporting date. Consideration is given to expected future wage and salary levels, the experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using market yields at the reporting date on high-quality corporate bonds with terms to maturity and currency that match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows. Defined contribution superannuation expense: contributions to defined contribution superannuation plans are expensed in the period in which they are incurred. Share-based payments: equity-settled share-based compensation benefits are provided to employees, equity-settled transactions are awards of shares, or options over shares, that are provided to employees in exchange for the rendering of services. The cost of equity-settled transactions are measured at fair value on grant date. Fair value is independently determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model that takes into account the exercise price, the term of the option, the impact of dilution, the share price at grant date and expected price volatility of the underlying share, the expected dividend yield and the risk free interest rate for the term of the option, together with non-vesting conditions that do not determine whether the consolidated entity receives the services that entitle the employees to receive payment. No account is taken of any other vesting conditions. The cost of equity-settled transactions are recognised as an  expense with a corresponding increase in equity at the vesting date which is at the grant date. The cumulative charge to profit or loss is calculated based on the grant date fair value of the award, the best estimate of the number of awards that are likely to vest and the expired portion of the vesting period. The amount recognised in profit or loss for the period is the cumulative amount calculated at each reporting date less amounts already recognised in previous periods. If equity-settled awards are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the modification has not been made. An additional expense is recognised, over the remaining vesting period, for any modification that increases the total fair value of the share-based compensation benefit as at the date of modification. If the non-vesting condition is within the control of the consolidated entity or employee, the failure to satisfy the condition is treated as a cancellation. If the condition is not within the control of the consolidated entity or employee and is not satisfied during the vesting period, any remaining expense for the award is recognised over the remaining vesting period, unless the award is forfeited. If equity-settled awards are cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any remaining expense is recognised immediately. If a new replacement award is substituted for the cancelled award, the cancelled and new award is treated as if they were a modification.\\n\\n', 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': 0.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\n## Issued capital\\nOrdinary shares are classified as equity.

These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. (1) Key Audit Matter: Recognition of R&D Tax Incentive (Note 6 and Note 10) The Group receives a corporate tax rate plus 18.5% (43.5%) refundable tax offset of eligible expenditure under the research and development (“R&D”) scheme if its turnover is less than $20 million per annum, provided it is not controlled by income tax-exempt entities. A registration of R&D activities is filed with AusIndustry in the following financial year, and based on this filing, the group receives the incentive in cash. The Group engaged an R&D expert to perform a detailed review of the Group’s total R&D expenditure to determine the potential claim under the R&D tax incentive legislation. As at 30 June 2022, a receivable totaling $1,035,645 has been recorded. This represents the estimated claim for the period 1 July 2021 to 30 June 2022. This is a key audit matter due to the size of the receivable. The degree of judgement and interpretation of the R&D tax legislation required by management to assess the eligibility of the R&D expenditure under the scheme. (2) How Our Audit Addressed the Key Audit Matter? Our procedures included, amongst others: Obtaining and documenting through discussions with management an understanding of the process to estimate the claim, Evaluating the competence, capabilities and objectivity of management’s expert, Reviewing and testing the R&D estimate by: reviewing the methodology used by management’s expert for consistency with the R&D tax offset rules, performing testing on a sample of R&D expenses to supporting documents to assess eligibility and accuracy of the amounts recorded in the general ledger, considering the nature of expenses against the eligibility criteria of the R&D tax incentive scheme to assess whether the expense included in the estimate are likely to meet the eligibility criteria. Comparing the nature of the R&D expenditure included in the current year to the prior year’s claim, Comparing the eligible expenditure used in the receivable calculation to expenditure recorded in the general ledger, Considering the entity’s history of successful claims, Inspecting copies of relevant correspondence with AusIndustry and the Australian Taxation Office related to the claims and Assessing the adequacy of the relevant disclosures in the financial statements.     \\n\\n', 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': 3.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\nKey Audit Matter: Inventory valuation (Note 11). As at 30 June 2022, the Group holds inventory with a carrying value of $5,877,879. The Group is required to carry their inventory at the lower of cost or net realisable value, in accordance with AASB 102 Inventories. Determining the value of inventory requires significant judgement. Specifically, estimating inventory provisions involves significant management judgement, including predictions about market conditions, future sales, and obsolescence. This is a key audit matter due to the materiality of the inventory balance and the level of management judgement required to determine the inventory value. How our audit addressed the key audit matter? Our procedures included, amongst others: Understanding and documenting management's process of calculating the inventory provision and evaluating the Group’s compliance with therequirements of AASB 102, Testing a sample of inventory items to assess the cost basis and net realisable value of inventories, Analysing slow-moving inventory and evaluating their saleability and obsolescence, Considering additional factors that may indicate inventory items require an adjustment to their carrying amount, including discontinued lines and Assessing the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': -1.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': \"\\n\\nKey Audit Matter: Revenue recognition (Note 5).

The total transaction price for a contract is based on their relative stand-alone selling price. Revenue is recognised at a point in time when the Group satisfies the performance obligations, which is generally at the point of delivery. This is a key audit matter given the judgement applied to determine the appropriate recognition of revenue and the material nature of revenue to the Group’s overall performance. How our audit addressed the key audit matter? Our procedures included, amongst others: Reviewing revenue recognition policies for appropriateness in accordance with AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Testing a sample of revenue transactions during the year and assessing whether revenue has been recognised in accordance with AASB 15, including:  (1) Reviewing the relevant contracts with customers, (2) Assessing management's determination of performance obligations within contracts and the allocation of the transaction price to those obligations, (3) Testing the timing of revenue recognition. Evaluating sales transactions around reporting date to assess whether revenue is recognised in the correct period, Performing non-substantive analytical procedures to assess revenue recognised against known business factors and investigating variances to our expectations and Assessing the adequacy of related disclosures in the financial statements.\\n\\n\", 'source': 'Rectifier_Technologies.txt', 'company_name': 'Rectifier Technologies Ltd', 'topic': -1.0, 'category': 'companies'}, {'chunk_text': '\\n\\n## Information other than the financial report and auditor’s report thereon: the Directors are responsible for the other information.
