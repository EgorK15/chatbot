CHAIRMAN'S REVIEW

Brave Bison competes in a growing and exciting marketplace at the intersection of social media, technology, data science and ecommerce.

We operate from trend to spend for our customers; promoting products, selling advertising on our channels and building transactional websites and apps to enable check out. Our vision is to build a company for the new era and the past twelve months have seen us consolidate and integrate across what has become our foundational platform.

Brave Bison operates across four business pillars:

Brave Bison Performance is a digital media advertising practice. We plan and buy media on platforms such as Google, Meta, TikTok, Amazon and YouTube. All of our work is focused on helping our customers drive conversion metrics such sales, downloads and subscriptions. Customers include New Balance, Curry's and Asus.

Brave Bison Commerce is a digital commerce practice. We provide technology services to help customers design and build next generation ecommerce platforms. Our teams use the latest MACH technology from partners such as Salesforce, Adobe, SAP and BigCommerce to design, launch, upgrade and support best-in-class ecommerce systems. Customers include Viking Direct, MKM Building Supplies and Muller.

Brave Bison Social & Influencer (re-branded to Social Chain as of February 2023) is a social media advertising practice. We create content for customers on social media platforms and work with influencers to make and distribute content. This creative approach ensures that content is native to the platform, leading to higher engagements from audiences. Customers include Panasonic, Vodafone, WWF and Rapyd.

Brave Bison Media Network is a portfolio of channels across YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram. These channels generate over 1 billion monthly views, and the advertising inventory from each channel is sold through online advertising exchanges. Popular channels include The Hook, PGA Tour, US Open and Link Up TV.

Whilst each of our business pillars is led by a Managing Director and supported by department heads, the Brave Bison platform is one of connection and collaboration. We have worked hard over the past year to ensure that, despite our four centres of excellence, we operate as one company, with a shared vision that aligns across each of our business pillars.

Year in Review

2022 was a strong year for Brave Bison. During the period revenue grew by 46% to almost £32m, gross profit more than doubled to just under £17m and the company generated adjusted EBITDA of over £3m, a YoY increase of 71%. At year end our balance sheet remained strong with net cash of over £6m, after having completed our third acquisition since Theo, Philippa and I joined the company mid 2020.

"We operate from trend to spend for our customers"
During the period the Leadership Team maintained a sharp operational focus. We completed the integration of four businesses, made our third acquisition, and relaunched an enhanced value and service proposition under a refreshed Brave Bison brand. This integrated and connected approach has already proven its ability to attract new customers and allow for effective cross selling across our four business units.

Best Response Media (BRM) was acquired during the period and integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. Until the acquisition, our efforts at Brave Bison Commerce were focused on three major enterprise ecommerce platforms: SAP, Salesforce and BigCommerce. Through the acquisition of BRM, we are now able to offer services on Adobe Commerce Cloud, a ubiquitous platform that has grown from strength-to-strength in recent years. Furthermore, we acquired a highly experienced and flexible resource base in Mansoura, Egypt, as well as Tier 1 customers including NatWest.

Brave Bison is headquartered in London, but the business operates across the world. We have staff in 11 countries and almost a quarter of our team works remotely. Furthermore, over 50% of our staff work on a hybrid basis, often choosing to come into the office between one and three days per week. This new way of working is an important part of our strategy moving forward and is telling of the digital age we are leaning into as a business. Our hybrid and remote workforce enables us to hire more quickly, cheaply and often from a more diverse pool of talent. This approach also means that, as we scale and grow our teams, we can keep property costs low whilst maintaining a strong culture through a mixture of virtual team events and quarterly in person socials.

Theo and I are committed to developing Brave Bison's board in a thoughtful and measured way, in line with modern standards of governance. The appointment of Gordon Brough as non-executive director during the period is a further indication of this commitment. Gordon has extensive experience in UK public companies having been General Counsel at Aberdeen Asset Management plc (subsequently the asset management arm of Abrdn) for almost 10 years. Gordon's legal experience, as well as his expertise in acquisitions will be crucial to the business as we look to further bolster our corporate profile.

Outlook

We are mindful of macroeconomic challenges over the next 12-18 months, but have confidence in the prevailing trend that continues to shift marketing budgets away from traditional advertising and into digital channels. Furthermore, our position in this expanding marketplace is differentiated and growing from strength-to-strength.

This organic growth will be compounded by our carefully considered Acquisition & Integration strategy that has proven successful to date. Our Leadership Team is both capable and focussed, and we anticipate that the acquisition of Social Chain (completed in February 2023) will have a transformative impact on our ability to win and deliver for customers in the social media advertising space.

CFO'S REVIEW

2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison.

Revenue increased by 46% to £31.7 million (2021: £21.7 million), gross profit increased by 117% to £16.9 million (2021: £7.8 million) and adjusted profit before tax, a measure of underlying profitability, increased by 86% to £2.6 million (2021: £1.4 million).

Organic growth of gross profit, removing the impact of businesses acquired during the period, was £1.8 million, or approximately 12%.

Principal Activities

Brave Bison has two business models.

Firstly, the provision of digital advertising and technology services to global blue-chip companies. Services provided include social media advertising, influencer marketing, paid media services, search engine optimisation services, ecommerce software integration, ecommerce system design and others. Customers include New Balance, Muller, Primark and Asus. This operation is referred to as "fee based services" in the Group segmental reporting.

The digital advertising and technology services business unit showed good growth during the year. Revenues increased by 169% to £19.7 million (2021: £7.3 million) and the gross profit approximately tripled to £14.0 million (2021: £4.8 million). In line with our acquisition and integration strategy, Greenlight Digital was integrated into Brave Bison Performance, and Greenlight Commerce and Best Response Media were integrated into Brave Bison Commerce.

Secondly, Brave Bison owns and operates a network of social and digital media channels. These channels principally exist on platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. Brave Bison publishes content on these channels which attract views and serve advertising which can be bought programmatically through digital advertising platforms. This operation is referred to as "advertising" in Group segmental reporting.

The advertising business unit generated revenue of £11.9 million (2021: £14.3 million) and approximately 1.3 billion views (2021: 1.7 billion). This decrease year-on-year largely relates to channels that are operated but not owned by Brave Bison on a revenue share basis, therefore the underlying gross profit remained broadly flat at £2.9 million (2021: £3.0 million). The small drop in gross profit was largely due to a softening of CPMs (cost per mille) in the second half of the year in response to macro-economic conditions. As we saw during the pandemic, this part of our business can be sensitive to such conditions, but tends to recover swiftly.

"2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison"
Margins & Operations

Brave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit before tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance indicator to measure the Group's financial performance.

The adjusted profit margin for the period was 15.4% (2021: 17.9%) a decrease year-on-year. This decrease was driven by the tripling of digital advertising and technology services net revenues which operates at a lower adjusted profit margin than advertising generated on the media network.

Despite the decrease in adjusted profit margin, Brave Bison has completed a number of initiatives to reduce the underlying operating costs of the business. These include a reduction in property costs through sub-letting excess office space, reduction in IT costs as business units are merged and careful resource management to reduce the staff cost to net revenue ratio for billable customers.

Exceptional Costs & Adjustments

During the year Brave Bison incurred restructuring costs of £0.1 million (2021:£0.2 million), relating to the restructuring and expansion of the Group's operations in Bulgaria, and acquisition costs of £0.1 million (2021: £0.7 million) relating to the costs associated with acquiring Best Response Media.

Brave Bison carried out a purchase price allocation exercise during the year in relation to the Greenlight acquisitions which completed in 2021, which resulted in identification of intangible assets relating to the acquired brands and customer relationships. As a result of the rebranding, and retirement of the Greenlight trade brand during the year, the amounts relating to this were impaired in full during the year, resulting in an impairment charge of £0.5 million (2021: £nil). The customer relationships are being amortised over a period of 10 years, resulting in a charge of £0.2 million (2021: £nil). As we deliver on our acquisition and integration strategy it is likely that both the amortisation of acquired intangibles, and impairment of acquired brands retired post-integration will continue to impact our financial statements.

Equity settled share-based payments relate to the value of share awards that have been granted to employees of the Group. £0.3 million of this amount relates to the directors' LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report. The earliest possible redemption date is December 2024, and redemption is contingent on the share price exceeding 3.0 pence.

Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that the Group uses to measure its performance and is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions and share based payments. It should be noted that a portion of the property costs in both 2022 and 2021 fall into the finance costs and depreciation lines as a result of the introduction of IFRS 16 'Leases'.
As a result, the Group also uses Adjusted profit before tax as a measure of performance, which is stated after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions, share based payments, impairments and amortisation of acquired intangibles, but which is after the deduction of costs associated with property leases.

: Adjusted EBITDA, 2022 £000's: 3,020, 2021 £000's: 1,762
: Finance costs, 2022 £000's: (86), 2021 £000's: (67)

: Profit before tax, 2022 £000's: 1,456, 2021 £000's: 458

*£0.3 million of the equity settled share based payments is a non-cash charge related to the director's LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report.

Financial Position

Brave Bison ended the period with cash resources of £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million) and net cash after deducting outstanding bank loans of £6.2 million (2021: £4.7 million). The bank loan relates to a Government-backed CBIL that is repayable over six years from drawdown.

In addition to the CBIL, Brave Bison has a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank for a total of £3 million, with an interest margin of 2.75% over Base Rate. This was agreed during the period but was undrawn at the period end.

The Group had cash inflow of £0.6 million during the period (2021: £3.2 million inflow), and expects to maintain positive cashflow throughout 2023. The decrease in cash inflow is largely due to a large customer prepayment received at the end of 2021, which subsequently unwound during the period.

In addition to this, the cashflow generated from operating activities was used to fund the acquisition of Best Response Media (£0.3 million) and the payment of deferred consideration in respect of the Greenlight acquisition made in 2021 (£0.8 million).

The Group is carrying intangible assets of £6.3 million (2021: £6.3 million). Based on an interim fair value exercise the Group capitalised goodwill of £0.2 million (2021: £6.2 million) on the purchase of Best Response Media (2021: Greenlight). The Group does not capitalise any wages.

SECTION 172 STATEMENT

For the year ended 31 December 2022

The Directors are aware of their responsibilities to promote the success of the Group for the benefit of its members as a whole in accordance with Section 172 of the Companies Act 2006, and in doing so to have regard to:

• The likely consequences of any decisions in the long term;
• the interests of the Group's employees;
• the need to foster the Group's business relationships with suppliers, customers and others;
• the desirability of the Group maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and
• the need to act fairly as between shareholders of the Company.

The Group's key stakeholders, and the way in which the Directors engage with them, are set out below:

Employees
The Board acknowledges that people are essential to the delivery of the Group's strategy and the Directors work hard to provide a productive working environment. Employees of the Group receive regular appraisals and performance reviews, and all-company meetings are held weekly to provide company updates. The Group conducts staff surveys to monitor progress of employment initiatives and areas for improvement. The Group is an equal opportunities employer and is committed to furthering diversity and inclusion throughout the business.

Appropriate policies and procedures are in place to ensure the Group complies with relevant legislation and regulations.

Shareholders
The Board is committed to open and transparent communications with all shareholder groups. The Directors have regular conversations with major shareholders, and the Group uses a stockbroker to manage professional investor relationships and introduce new professional investors. Furthermore, the Group utilises free-to-use platforms to enable retail investors to engage with the Group, attend the AGM and receive presentations on financial performance and strategy.
Customers, Platforms & Suppliers
The Group's customers are the clients and channel partners who appoint the Group to undertake programmes of work. Customers are serviced by dedicated employees of the Group, and customers receive updates on progress by way of regular business reviews.

The Group works with various social and digital media platforms to publish and monetise video content, as well as advertise on behalf of customers. The Group has dedicated teams that meet regularly with each platform, and discuss current performance, new opportunities and new products.

The Group has long-standing relationships with suppliers and treats all suppliers fairly. Contractual commitments to suppliers are met within a timely manner.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES

Risk: Dependence on key personnel and employees, Potential Risk Description: The continued success of the Group depends partly upon the performance and expertise of its current and future key executives and personnel. A lack of skilled workforce could result in a drop in service levels and customer dissatisfaction, and therefore have an adverse impact on the Group in terms of its reputation. The loss of such individuals, or the failure to train and attract other high calibre individuals may impact on the Group's business and the Group's ability to achieve its targets., Mitigating Factors: The Group ensures all its employees are supported and managed by way of regular performance appraisals. Furthermore, the Group incentivises key employees using performance-related bonus plans and share option awards that vest over a multi-year period.
Risk: Competitive industry dynamics, Potential Risk Description: The Group operates in a highly complex and rapidly changing industry. If the Group is not able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected., Mitigating Factors: The Board believes the Group has adopted a competitive business strategy to increase the profits of the business. The Group has implemented an acquisitive business model to improve its capabilities and scale within the markets which it operates. Furthermore, the Group maintains a substantial net cash position to provide flexibility in the event of a more competitive and less profitable trading environment.
Risk: Dependence on the operating policies of key platforms, Potential Risk Description: The Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue from three international technology platforms which are subject to external factors beyond the Group's control. Changes to the commercial agreements or policies implemented by these platforms could have a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group has diversified its business model away from the advertising platforms, which now only account for 38% (FY21: 66%) of the Group's revenues. Furthermore, the Group has diversified its revenues between three platforms to reduce the impact of any single platform policy change.
Risk: Impact of Pandemics, Potential Risk Description: A pandemic could cause an adverse impact on the Group's financial position. Customer marketing budgets could reduce, which may result in lower revenues. The Group's employees may be unable to service customers due to sickness or disruption to the Group's operations., Mitigating Factors: The Group operates a robust hybrid working system where its employees are not normally required to be physically present in an office in order to deliver work for customers.
Risk: Foreign Currency Risk, Potential Risk Description: The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange movements in the US dollar. These movements could result in a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposure. All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement on translation at the reporting date.

OPERATIONAL REPORT

The Brave Bison Business Model

Every year many trillions of physical and digital products and services are sold online, and in 2021 over half a trillion dollars was spent advertising these products and services across digital platforms. Furthermore, businesses across the world are spending billions on their digital transformation, often, but not solely, in an effort to make their products and services more accessible in an online world.

Brave Bison is a digital media, digital advertising and technology company, built to exist in this new era. We provide our customers with products and services at each step of this value chain.

Each of our business units, Brave Bison Performance, Brave Bison Commerce, Brave Bison Social & Influencer (now Social Chain) and the Brave Bison Media Network, offers a specialism in this complex digital transformation of global economies.

ESG REPORT

ENVIRONMENTAL

As a digital media, digital advertising and technology services group, the direct and indirect impact of the Group on the environment is low. Nevertheless, we continue to aim to reduce our environmental impact.

Our sustainability strategy has 3 pillars, emissions, waste & recycling and consumables.

Carbon emissions:
As a service business our energy use is by far our biggest contributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity and gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal (non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with simple but effective office measures.

The most important of these is our pledge to offset actual carbon emissions or the highest year of emissions – providing a direct incentive to staff to save energy, since any reduction below our worst year translates into the business being carbon negative. This is critical and, we believe, unique, as it removes the implicit "permission to emit" that carbon offsetting programmes can otherwise create.

Carbon Emissions are classified as Scope 1, 2 or 3. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, Scope 2 is made up of indirect emissions that a company is directly responsible for, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and emissions from public transport made on company business, and Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that the company is indirectly responsible for. Scope 3 is wide and includes emissions from cloud computing, emissions associated with the manufacture of office equipment and much more.

Our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions are measured in the first half of each year for the prior year. We partner with specialist consultants Carbon Footprint Ltd to assess and verify our footprint. The assessment includes rigorous estimates of the impact of our people working from home, which they now do a significant proportion of the time. From this year we intend our reports will cover the entirety of Scope 3 emissions, making 2022 the first year a complete and unflinching benchmark of our Carbon Footprint has been made.

Our offsetting programme is a blend of avoided deforestation (REDD) in the Amazon, reforesting in Africa, UK tree planting, and clean cooking technology in rural China and India (where wood and coal burning is otherwise prevalent). Finally, we plant 15 trees for every new client win or renewed client contract in our Tree Nation forest.

As our measurement to date has been for Scopes 1, 2 and part of Scope 3, we only claim Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality (or carbon negativity in years where our offsetting is greater than our emissions). Following 2022's Carbon Footprint assessment which we expect to be complete by the end of May, it's our ambition to make a Net Zero commitment in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative, accompanied by a plan to reach Net Zero across all scopes.

Other measures include automatic timers on our TV's and communication with our staff about the impact their energy use has. Travel was significantly reduced as a result of COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel where possible.
Waste & Recycling
The Group operates a largely paperless office. All employees are advised that documents and emails should not be printed, instead accessed via shared digital drives. When required, printers are set to double-sided and black and white, the aim being to reduce the use of both paper and toner.

We have long been a Group that aims to recycle as much waste as possible. We have clearly labelled recycling points stationed around the offices, and avoid bins at desks to encourage their use.

Consumables
We have an ongoing programme designed to minimise the environmental impact of our consumption beyond greenhouse gases and recycling.

Livestock farming generates a significant percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, with red meat and dairy producing the majority of this. A third of the water used for farming goes toward rearing farm animals. Soy and oat milk alternatives are provided, again reducing our dairy farming impact while avoiding water intensive almond milk. From this year, our ambition is to stop the routine purchase of any meat in food bought for staff and clients, with exceptions only for special events and requests.

We have removed all plastic bottled water from our London office and installed fresh still and sparkling water taps instead, avoiding over 600 single use plastic bottles every month.

Lastly, we only buy 100% recycled paper for our office printers.

SOCIAL

Brave Bison is committed to developing a diverse workforce, an inclusive culture and the removal of barriers for underrepresented groups.

56% of employees are male and 44% of employees are female. Within the Senior Leadership Team, 70% are male and 30% are female. During 2022 we carried out a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging survey, and from the responses 35% of employees self-identify as being from an ethnic minority background.

Brave Bison seeks to achieve the highest ethical standards and behaviours in conducting its business, with integrity, openness, diversity and inclusiveness being high priority from the Board to senior management and throughout the workforce.

The Company has adopted a formal equal opportunities policy which is contained in our employee handbook. The aim of the policy is to ensure no job applicant, employee or worker is discriminated against either directly or indirectly on the grounds of race, sex, disability, sexual orientation, gender reassignment; marriage or civil partnership; pregnancy or maternity; religion or belief or age.

In conducting our business and developing strategy we have placed greater emphasis on social and environmental considerations, embarking on a number of initiatives including:

• Running diversity and inclusion and unconscious bias training for all staff;
• Monthly 'Lunch & Learn' sessions where we have guest speakers from various sectors and backgrounds;
• Encouraging employees to take two paid days to volunteer in the local community; and
• Offering unlimited online coaching for all staff.
GOVERNANCE

The Board believes that governance is central to the effective delivery of our mission and strategy. With this in mind, the Board is committed to ensuring that all decision-making and the oversight it provides promotes success for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, while being respectful of the interests of other key stakeholders. This includes our partners, customers and employees.

The Board has a strong balance of industry knowledge and financial experience. We have established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated duties and responsibilities and with written terms of reference. From time to time, separate committees may be set up by the Board to consider specific issues when the need arises.

Further information on the Group's compliance with the QCA Code can be found on the Group's website on the AIM Rule 26 page.
The Composition of the Board
The Board is responsible for the strategic direction, investment decisions and effective control of the Group. As at 31 December 2022 the Board comprised three Executive Directors and two Non-Executive Directors.

The Board reviews the effectiveness of its performance and that of its committees and individual Directors and is satisfied that, between the Directors, it has an effective and appropriate balance of skills and knowledge, including a range of financial, commercial, sector specific, public market and entrepreneurial experience.

The Board is also satisfied that it has a suitable balance between independence (of character and judgement) and knowledge of the Group to enable it to discharge its duties and responsibilities effectively. Matthew Law and Gordon Brough are considered to be independent. No single Director is dominant in the decision-making process.

The Group does not have an independent Chairman given the executive function of the Chairman. The Executive Chairman has a significant shareholding in the Company. The Group does not have a separate CEO and, where appropriate, the Executive Chairman assumes the role of CEO. While it is the Board's opinion that the current arrangements are appropriate to the Company at this stage of development the Board recognises the Code requirement on splitting the roles and will keep this under review. Meanwhile there are sufficient compliance structures within the Company to ensure that the governance functions that would be part of an independent Chairman's responsibility are met. The Executive Chairman will meet regularly with the Independent Directors to discuss the operation of the Board and strategy.

The Board aims to convene 6 times a year, with additional meetings being held as required. Board meetings are a mix of virtual and in person.

Prior to their appointment, the Company informed each Director of the nature of their role, their responsibilities and duties to the Company, and the time commitment involved. On appointment, each Director confirmed that, taking into account all of their other commitments, they were able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their role effectively. The Board is satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors each devote sufficient time to the Company and that there have been no significant changes to their other commitments.

The Audit & Risk Committee is responsible for the annual and half-yearly reports to shareholders, other public announcements of a financial nature, review of the likelihood of any fraud risks, review of the effectiveness of the Group's internal control and risk management system and oversight of the relationship with the external auditors. The Audit & Risk Committee also reviews the appointment of the external auditor, their independence, the audit fee, and any questions of resignation or dismissal.

The Remuneration Committee met twice during the year.

Risk management and internal controls

Conflicts of Interest
Outside interests and commitments of Directors, and any changes to these commitments are reported to and agreed by the Board.

Related Party Transactions
Transactions between parties related to the Directors are conducted at an arms-length basis and are subject to the Related Party Policy, which is implemented by the Board. Details of related party transactions conducted during the period are outlined in the financial statements.

Insurance and indemnity
In accordance with Article 54 of the Group's articles of association, Directors are entitled to an indemnity against liabilities incurred by them in the actual or purported exercise of their duties, or exercise of their powers including liability incurred in defending any proceedings (whether civil or criminal) which relate to anything done or omitted to be done and in which judgment is given in his favour, or in which he is acquitted, or which are otherwise disposed of.

The Group has purchased and maintains Directors' liability insurance cover against certain legal liabilities and costs for claims incurred in respect of any act or omission in the execution of their duties and which has been in place throughout the year.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, and at least for 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements. The Group is dependent for its working capital requirements on cash generated from operations, and cash holdings. The cash holdings of the Group at 31 December 2022 were £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million). The Group made a profit before tax of £1.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £0.5 million), and generated an increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of £0.6 million (2021: £3.2 million). The Group has net assets of £10.0 million (2021: £7.5 million).

The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections for the period to 31 December 2023 and for the following 6 month period to 30 June 2024 which are based on their current expectations of trading prospects. The Group achieved positive cashflow of £1.1 million in H2 2022, and the Board forecasts that the Group will continue to achieve positive cash inflows in 2023.

The Directors are confident that the Group's cash flow projections are achievable, and are committed to taking any actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in forecast revenue receipts is mitigated by cost savings.

The Directors continue to maintain rolling forecasts which are regularly updated.

The Directors remain confident that the Group has sufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and accordingly, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Brave Bison Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2022, with comparative information presented for the year ended 31 December 2021. No profit and loss account is presented for Brave Bison Group plc as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.

Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies and is exposed to or has rights over variable returns from its involvements with the investee and has the power to affect returns. Brave Bison Group plc obtains and exercises control through more than half of the voting rights for all its subsidiaries. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December and are consolidated from the acquisition date, which is the date from which control passes to Brave Bison Group plc.

2.2. Adoption of new and revised standards
The Group has applied the following amendments:
• IFRS 3 – Reference to the Conceptual Framework;
• IAS 16 – Property, Plant and Equipment: Proceeds before intended use;
• IAS 37 – Onerous Contracts: Cost of Fulfilling a Contract; and
• Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2018 – 2020 Cycle.

Other Standards and amendments that are not yet effective and have not been adopted early by the Company include:
• Amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2 – Disclosure of Accounting Policies;
• Amendments to IAS 8 – Definition of Accounting Estimates;
• Amendments to IAS 12 – Deferred Tax related to Assets and Liabilities arising from a Single Transaction;
• Amendments to IAS 1 – Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-current;
• Amendments to IAS 1 – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants; and
• Amendments to IFRS 16 – Lease Liability in a Sale and Leaseback.

The directors have assessed the standards above and they will not have a material impact in future periods.

3 Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the accounting policies and presentation required by UK adopted International Accounting Standards, and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee ("IFRIC") Interpretations as endorsed for use in the UK. The financial statements have also been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 that are relevant to companies that prepare financial statements in accordance with UK adopted International Accounting Standards.

4 Summary of accounting policies
The Group's presentation and functional currency is £ (Sterling). The financial statements are presented in thousands of pounds (£000's) unless otherwise stated.
4.1. Revenue
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for services provided in the normal course of business, net of discounts and sales related taxes.

Revenue is recognised when the amount of revenue can be measured reliably, it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity, the costs incurred or to be incurred can be measured reliably, and when the criteria for each of the Group's different activities has been met.

The determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgement and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. The Group is deemed to be acting as a principal in all significant contracts.

The accounting policies specific to the Group's key operating revenue categories are outlined below:

Advertising revenue:
• Ad-funded YouTube channel management of third party content owners' videos. Revenue is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligation of delivering monetised views occurs;
• Monetisation of the Group's owned and operated brands and videos via platforms such as Facebook and Snapchat. Revenue is recognised at the point in time when the performance obligation of delivering monetised views occurs.

Fee Based Service revenue:
• Social Media and Influencer services. Providing social media consultancy and strategy services, and providing creative and influencer management services. Revenue from providing these services is recognised over the time that the performance obligations to provide services are satisfied;
• License fee revenues for the Group's own content and third parties' content are recognised at the point in time when the performance obligation of delivering the content is satisfied;
• Performance marketing services. Revenue from providing these services is recognised over the time that the performance obligations to provide services are satisfied;
• Technology services. Revenue from providing these services is recognised over the time that the performance obligations to provide services are satisfied.

4.2. Interest and dividend income
Interest income and expenses are reported on an accrual basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income, other than from investments in associates, is recognised at the time the right to receive payment is established.

4.3. Government grants
Government grants are recognised at the fair value of the asset received or receivable when there is reasonable assurance that the grant conditions will be met and the grants will be received.

A grant that specifies performance conditions is recognised in income when the performance conditions are met. Where a grant does not specify performance conditions it is recognised in income when the proceeds are received or receivable. A grant received before the recognition criteria are satisfied is recognised as a liability. Government grants are presented as a deduction from the related expense.

4.4. Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was determined.

Any exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates different from those at which they were initially recorded are recognised in the profit or loss in the period in which they arise.

The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate on the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries and on income and expenses during the year are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the "translation reserve" in equity.

4.5. Segment reporting
IFRS 8 Operating Segments requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive (chief operating decision maker – CODM).

The Board has reviewed the Group and all revenues are functional activities of a digital media and marketing group, and these activities take place on an integrated basis. The senior executive team review the financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole, but view the business as having 2 key pillars, being the Media Network and the Digital Advertising and Technology Services. The Group will provide a split between these two pillars, as well as a split by geographical location. Segmental information is presented in accordance with IFRS 8 for all periods presented within Note 6.

4.6. Leasing
For any new contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. To apply this definition the Group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether:

• The contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Group;
• The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract;
• The Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Group assess whether it has the right to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset is used throughout the period of use.
At lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right‑of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received).

The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.

At the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.

Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments.

When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use is already reduced to zero.

4.7. Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment. Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives less estimated residual values, using the straight line method. The rates generally applicable are:

• Fixtures & Fittings – 3 years or over remaining lease term
• Computer Equipment – 3 years

The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

The assets' residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.

The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.
4.8. Impairment of property, plant and equipment
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.

Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, are shown at fair value at the date of the acquisition less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to profit or loss. The rates applicable, which represent the Directors' best estimate of the useful economic life, are:

• Customer relationships – 5 to 10 years
• Online channel content – 3 to 5 years
• Brands – 3 years
• Technology – 1 to 5 years

Goodwill is not amortised but is instead reviewed for impairment on an annual basis as outlined below.

4.9. Impairment of intangible assets
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.

Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
4.10. Development costs
Expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:

• Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;
• The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and the asset will generate probable future economic benefits (over and above cost);
• There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
• The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably.

Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include employee (other than Director) costs incurred along with third party costs.

4.11. Investments in associates and joint ventures
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The carrying amount of the investment in associates and joint ventures is increased or decreased to recognise the Group's share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associate or joint venture, adjusted where necessary to ensure consistency with the accounting policies of the Group.

4.12. Taxation
Tax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.

Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be recognised.

Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
4.13. Financial Instruments
Recognition and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.

Loan and other receivables
The Group accounts for loan and other receivables by recording the loss allowance as lifetime expected credit losses. These are shortfalls in contractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at any point during the life of the financial instrument. The Group uses its historical experience, external indicators and forward-looking information to calculate expected credit losses.

Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.

Contract assets and liabilities
The Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

4.14. Equity, reserves and dividend payments
Share capital
Share capital represents the nominal value of shares that have been issued.

Share premium
Share premium includes any premiums received on issue of share capital. Any transaction costs associated with the issuing of shares are deducted from share premium arising on those shares, net of any related income tax benefits.

Retained deficits
Retained deficits include all current and prior period retained profits or losses. It also includes credits arising from share based payment charges.

Translation reserve
Translation reserve represents the differences arising from translation of investments in overseas subsidiaries.

Merger reserve
The merger reserve is created when group reconstruction accounting is applied. The difference between the cost of investment and the nominal value of the share capital acquired is recognised in a merger reserve.

Merger relief reserve
Where the following conditions are met, any excess consideration received over the nominal value of the shares issued is recognised in the merger relief reserve:
• the consideration for shares in another company includes issued shares; and
• on completion of the transaction, the company issuing the shares will have secured at least a 90% equity holding in the other company.
Capital redemption reserve
Where the Company purchases its own equity share capital, on cancellation, the nominal value of the shares cancelled is deducted from share capital and the amount is transferred to the capital redemption reserve.

Dividend distributions payable to equity shareholders are included in 'other liabilities' when the dividends have been approved in a general meeting prior to the reporting date.

4.15. Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, together with other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash having maturities of 3 months or less from inception and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, and bank overdrafts.

4.16. Employee benefits
The Group operates two schemes on behalf of its employees, private healthcare and a defined contribution pension plan and amounts due are expensed as they fall due.

4.17. Share based payments
Employees (including Directors) of the Group received remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares ('equity-settled transactions'). The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments to all grants of equity instruments. The transactions have been treated as equity settled.

The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instrument granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding charge to equity, over the period between the date of grant and the end of a vesting period, where relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. The total value of the options has been pro-rated and allocated on a weighted average basis.

4.18. Restructuring Costs
Restructuring costs relate to corporate re-organisation activities previously undertaken or announced, as detailed in note 8.

4.19. Provisions
The Group has recognised a provision for the costs to restore leased property to its original condition, as required by the terms and conditions of the lease. This is recognised when the obligation is incurred, either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period of the lease, at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to restore the assets. Estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for new circumstances.

5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements under UK adopted International Accounting Standards requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.
5.1. Critical accounting judgements

Intangible assets and impairment
The Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is determined by experts engaged by management and based upon management's and the Directors' judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore management must estimate the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.

Trade receivables' recovery
Within trade debtors there is a balance of £0.7 million (2021: £0.7 million) which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is because it believes it is recoverable, since there is a trade payable balance of £0.8 million (2021: £0.8 million) with the same company, and the Group is anticipating reaching agreement that these balances may be set off against each other.

Treatment of revenue as agent or principal
The determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. These include if the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service, if the Group has inventory risk before the good or services has been transferred to the customer and if the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the good or service.

Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.

Greenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation
The purchase price allocation of the Greenlight acquisition was fully assessed in the year, within the one year IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, and acquired intangibles were identified and a full valuation exercise carried out in relation to the Greenlight trade name and the customer relationships. The purchase price has been reallocated accordingly.

Best Response Media acquisition and purchase price allocation
The purchase price allocation of the Best Response Media acquisition was provisionally assessed, and the Group judged that at the interim valuation stage it was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. A full valuation exercise will be completed within the one year IFRS3 measurement period from the date of acquisition which may recognise additional intangible assets separately from goodwill.
5.2. Estimates

Share based payment charges
The Group is required to measure the fair value of its share based payments. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes method which requires assumptions regarding exchange rate volatility, the risk free rate, share price volatility and the expected life of the share based payment. Exchange rate volatility is calculated using historic data over the past three years. The volatility of the Group's share price has been calculated as the average of similar listed companies over the preceding periods. The risk-free rate range used is between 0% and 1.25% and management, including the Directors, have estimated the expected life of most share based payments to be 4 years.

Bad debt provision
Recoverability of some receivables may be doubtful although not definitely irrecoverable. Where management feel recoverability is in doubt an appropriate provision is made for the possibility that the amounts may not be recovered in full. Provisions are made using past experience however subjectivity is involved when assessing the level of provision required.

Financial risk management

The Group's financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations. The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks. The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows:
Foreign currency risk
Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of services from the UK to overseas clients, and from the import of services directly sourced from overseas suppliers. The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange in relation to movements in sterling against the US Dollar, the Euro and the Singapore Dollar.

The Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposures. All gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss on translation at the reporting date. The Group's current exposures in respect of currency risk are as follows:

: Financial assets, Sterling £000's: 9,297, US Dollar £000's: 2,606, Singapore Dollar £000's: 22, Euro £000's: 266, Other £000's: -, Total £000's: 12,191

Sensitivity analysis

The table below illustrates the estimated impact on profit or loss as a result of market movements in the US Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Euro and Sterling exchange rate.

Impact on loss and equity:

: For the year to 31 December 2021, 10% Increase US Dollars £000's: (26), 10% Decrease US Dollars £000's: 26, 10% Increase Singapore Dollars £000's: 16, 10% Decrease Singapore Dollars £000's: (16), 10% Increase Euro £000's: (13), 10% Decrease Euro £000's: 13

Credit risk
The Group's principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk and manages this by running quarterly credit checks and setting appropriate credit limits. The maximum exposure to credit risk is that shown within the balance sheet. Management has assessed the exposure to credit risk and has provided against any items which is considered to be high risk.
Liquidity/funding risk
The Group's funding strategy is to ensure a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.

Interest rate risk
The Group holds the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in corporate current accounts and interest bearing money market accounts. These accounts offer a competitive interest rate with the advantage of quick access to the funds. The Group is in a net cash positive position and management consider there to be a low level of risk.

Capital policy
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure that optimises the cost of capital.

The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the statement of financial position and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.

Financial instruments measured at fair value
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three levels of fair value hierarchy. This grouping is determined based on the lowest level of significant inputs used in fair value measurement, as follows:

• level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Group categorises all financial assets and liabilities as level 1.

Maturity analysis
Set out below is a maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. The Group had no derivative financial liabilities at either reporting date.

On the 28 April 2022, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Best Response Media Limited. The consideration was financed by existing cash balances. Best Response Media Limited is a specialist ecommerce and mobile development company focused exclusively on the Adobe Commerce Platform.

The provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:

: Goodwill, Book value £000's: 239, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 239
: Tangible Assets, Book value £000's: 1, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1

: , Book value £000's: 1,174, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1,174

The consideration for the acquisition was as follows:

: Initial cash consideration – paid, £000's: 962
: Completion accounts adjustment – paid, £000's: 37
: Deferred cash consideration – paid, £000's: 175
: , £000's: 1,174

The consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes £0.1 million of acquisition costs in relation to Best Response Media Limited.

The fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of £0.2 million and a gross contractual value of £0.3 million. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.1 million. The goodwill represents the acquired accumulated workforce and the synergies expected from integrating Best Response Media into the Group's existing business. The Group has carried out an interim fair value adjustment exercise and will be completing a full exercise within the one year measurement period from the date of the acquisition in accordance with IFRS3. At the interim valuation stage the Group has not been able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other identifiable assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. Once the full valuation exercise has been completed additional intangible assets may be recognised separately from goodwill.

Best Response Media Limited contributed £0.5 million revenue and £0.2 million loss to the Group's profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the reporting date.

If the acquisition of Best Response Media Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been £32 million and Group profit would have been £1.9 million.

30 Post balance sheet events

On the 3 February 2023 the Group announced the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital of Social Chain Limited. The initial consideration for the acquisition consisted of a payment of £7.7m. This was partially funded by way of an oversubscribed vendor placing to raise £4.75 million. Social Chain is one of the UK's leading social media and influencer marketing agencies. The completion balance sheet in relation to the acquisition is still being prepared, and therefore a breakdown of the assets and liabilities acquired has not been disclosed.
