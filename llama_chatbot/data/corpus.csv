"Do you process data requests? Secret chats use end-to-end encryption, thanks to which we don't have any data to disclose. To protect the data that is not covered by end-to-end encryption, Telegram uses a distributed infrastructure. Cloud chat data is stored in multiple data centers around the globe that are controlled by different legal entities spread across different jurisdictions. The relevant decryption keys are split into parts and are never kept in the same place as the data they protect. As a result, several court orders from different jurisdictions are required to force us to give up any data. Thanks to this structure, we can ensure that no single government or block of like-minded countries can intrude on people's privacy and freedom of expression. Telegram can be forced to give up data only if an issue is grave and universal enough to pass the scrutiny of several different legal systems around the world. To this day, we have disclosed 0 bytes of user messages to third parties, including governments."

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued
Our approach to the audit
In designing our audit, we determined materiality, and assessed the risk of material misstatement in the financial
statements. In particular, we looked at areas where the Directors made significant judgements, comprising the fair
value of investments at level 2 or 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We also assessed the risk of management override
of internal controls.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of
the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material
misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) we identified, including those which had the greatest effect on: the
overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit; and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming
our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key Audit Matter: How our scope addressed this matter
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss (Note 10): The Company holds equity investments with a carrying value of £6m (2021: £14m) as at 30 September 2022. The portfolio consists largely of listed investments, and thus are valued under Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. Unlisted investments are subject to management valuation, and thus are exposed to significant levels of management judgement and estimation. These investments have been written down to £Nil in previous periods. Based upon the significance of the value of the investments held at the year end, this was determined to be a Key Audit Matter.
Our work in this area included:
- Reviewing the valuation methodology for each type of investment held and ensuring the carrying values are supported by sufficient and appropriate audit evidence;
- Ensuring that investments are categorised and disclosed correctly in accordance with UK GAAP;
- Agreeing year-end fair values to independent sources of price data;
- Ensuring that the company has legal title to the investments held; and
- Performing tests of detail on investment disposals in the year.
Other information
The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, other than the financial statements
and our auditor’s report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information contained within the
annual report. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, except to the
extent otherwise explicitly stated in our report, we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon. Our
responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially
inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the course of the audit, or otherwise
appears  to  be  materially  misstated.  If  we  identify  such  material  inconsistencies  or  apparent  material
misstatements, we are required to determine whether this gives rise to a material misstatement in the financial
statements themselves. If, based  on the work we  have performed, we conclude that there  is a material
misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022
1.  Company Information
Starvest plc is a Public Limited Company incorporated in England & Wales. The registered office is Salisbury
House, London Wall, London, EC2M 5PS. The Company's shares are listed on the AIM market of the London
Stock Exchange. These Financial Statements (the ""Financial Statements"") have been prepared and approved by
the Directors on 07 February 2023 and signed on their behalf by Mark Badros and Gemma Cryan.
2.  Basis of Preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting
standards, including Financial Reporting Standard 102 – ‘The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the
United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland’ (‘FRS102’), and with the Companies Act 2006. The financial statements
have been prepared on the historical cost basis. There are no fair value adjustments other than to the carrying
value of the Company’s trade investments. The financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is
also the functional currency of the company.
Going concern
The Company's day to day financing is from its available cash resources and, on occasion, by the part disposal of
investments and use of short-term loans.
The Directors are confident that adequate funding can be raised as required to meet the Company's current and
future liabilities, which has been confirmed within the cash flow forecast prepared by the Board for the 12 months
ending 29 February 2024. In the unlikely event that such finance could not be raised, the Directors could raise
sufficient funds by disposal of certain of its current asset trade investments.
As at the date of this report, the Company has no borrowings.
For the reasons outlined above, the Directors are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its current and
future liabilities, and continue trading, for the foreseeable future and, in any event, for a period of not less than
twelve months from the date of approving the financial statements. The preparation of the financial statements on
a going concern basis is therefore considered to remain appropriate.
3.  Principal Accounting Policies
Administrative expenses
All administrative expenses are stated inclusive of VAT, where applicable, as the company is not eligible to reclaim
VAT incurred on its costs.
Taxation
Corporation tax payable is provided on taxable profits at the current rates enacted or substantially enacted at the
balance sheet date.
Under FRS102, investments are valued on a mark-to-market basis using publicly quoted trading prices at year
end irrespective of whether they are classified as fixed or current assets.  However, pursuant to Part 3, Chapter 3,
Corporation Tax Act 2009, any increase in the value of a current asset is recognised as a trading profit and
immediately subject to Corporation Tax when a company is classified as a trading company under HMRC rules
and regulations, whereas an increase in the value of a fixed asset is not subject to taxation until the asset is
disposed  of when  a  company  is classified  as an  investment  company.  Reported profit under UK GAAP is
unaffected.

"What is this Encryption Key thing? When a secret chat is created, the participating devices exchange encryption keys using the so-called Diffie-Hellman key exchange. After the secure end-to-end connection has been established, we generate a picture that visualizes the encryption key for your chat. You can then compare this image with the one your friend has — if the two images are the same, you can be sure that the secret chat is secure, and no man-in-the-middle attack can succeed. Newer versions of Telegram apps will show a larger picture along with a textual representation of the key (this is not the key itself, of course!) when both participants are using an updated app. Always compare visualizations using a channel that is known to be secure — it's safest if you do this in person, in an offline meeting with the conversation partner."

Portfolio review
Our primary investments in companies include the following:
Greatland Gold plc (www.greatlandgold.com)
Greatland Gold plc (“Greatland”), an AIM-listed exploration company, represents by far the largest part of the
Company’s portfolio and holds six exploration projects, four in Western Australia and two in Tasmania. Greatland
also has farm-in and joint venture agreements in place with its major partner, Newcrest Mining Ltd.
The company, in conjunction with Newcrest, has continued to report excellent drilling results from the Havieron
project and increased its Initial Inferred Mineral Resource estimate, independently of Newcrest, from 4.2Moz AuEq
to 6.5Moz AuEq in March 2022. The increased estimate was ratified in August 2022 when Newcrest released its
own resource upgrade. Neither resource takes into account drilling carried out after February 2022, which could
yield a significant increase in resource if included. Drilling to date has not yet closed off the deposit, with Havieron
remaining open at depth and in multiple directions, allowing for significant resource growth in the future.
In addition, Greatland took several corporate and financial actions this year. Newcrest boosted its stake in
Havieron to 70% but declined to exercise an option to acquire an additional 5% of the project. Greatland
subsequently raised US$35m in an over-subscribed placing and is well-funded to continue exploration and funding
its part of the Havieron development. In September 2022, the company announced that two former Fortescue
Metals Group executives would join the board in January 2023 and also added a former BHP executive, all of
whom add a new dynamic to Greatland’s leadership team and are able to take the company forward as a significant
mid-tier developer in the near term. Around the same time, the company entered into a significant finance
agreement, with a bank debt facility of A$200m committed through a syndicate of leading international banks and
secured a strategic equity investment of up to A$120m from Wyloo Metals, which will fund Greatland fully through
to production.
Significant activities since year end: Greatland announced that drilling permits have been granted on the Ernest
Giles licence. Havieron drilling updates continue to confirm the potential to greatly expand the size of this deposit
with high-grade extensions to mineralisation in the Eastern Breccia, South East Crescent Zone and Northern
Breccia. The mine decline is at over 900m development length and now in more competent rock. The feasibility
study is due during 2023 and will likely include more up to date drilling data once completed thus further de-risking
the project.
Greatland entered into an option agreement to sell its two Tasmania exploration licences to Flynn Gold for an
initial purchase price of A$200,000 with deferred consideration and a royalty equal to 1% net smelter returns from
any future production.
Ariana Resources plc (www.arianaresources.com)
Ariana Resources PLC (“Ariana”) is a United Kingdom-based company engaged in the exploration, development
and mining of epithermal gold-silver and porphyry copper-gold deposits in Turkey and exploration in Cyprus and
south-east Europe along with investments in other projects through its metals development fund, Asgard Metals.
During the year Ariana reported revenue of US$177m at Zenit Madencilik, its investee company, from continued
successful production at the Kilitepe mine. Through the first half of 2022, with production of 13,378 oz Au, it was
on track to exceed the company’s annual guidance of 25,000 oz for the fifth year running. The company reported
that this will allow them to sustain its business, enable growth and maintain its dividend rate. For the six months
to June 2022 (the latest published but unaudited accounts), Ariana earned £2.5m in profits before tax.
Elsewhere in Turkey Ariana received a positive Environmental Impact Assessment at its Tavsan project which
they are working to develop as its second gold mine, with a targeted annual production rate of approximately
30,000 oz Au. Construction of the mine is underway and scheduled for completion in H2 2023.

Corporate governance statement, continued
Each member of the board is committed to spending sufficient time to enable them to carry out their duties;
Executive  Directors  commit  a  minimum  of  twenty  hours  per  week,  with  periods  where  this  is  increased
considerably, such as mid-term and end of year reporting periods as well as times when investment transactions
are being undertaken. Non-Executive Directors are expected to commit at least one hour per week to the company
and, as with the executive team, are likely to exceed this many times throughout any twelve-month period.
Role of the Board
The Board has a responsibility to govern the Company rather than to manage it and in doing so act in the best
interests of the Company as a whole. Each member of the board is committed to spending sufficient time to enable
them to carry out their duties as a Director; through various activities including but not limited to: researching and
reviewing  potential  investments,  shareholder  engagement,  stakeholder  engagement,  administrative  and
accounting tasks, monitoring of market conditions and investee company activities.
Responsibilities of the Board
The Board is responsible for formulating, reviewing and approving the Company’s strategy, financial activities and
operating performance. Day-to-day management is devolved to the Executive Directors who are charged with
consulting the Board on all significant financial and operational matters.
Board meetings
All Directors are required to attend board and board committee meetings, every quarter at a minimum throughout
the year and to be available at other times as required for face-to-face and telephone meetings. Board meetings
are led by the Chair and follow an agenda that is circulated prior to the meeting. Every board meeting is minuted
and every Director is aware of the right to have any concerns minuted and to seek independent advice at the
Company’s expense where appropriate.
The Board meets regularly throughout the year.
Board member attendance during the financial year to 30 September 2022:

Portfolio review, continued
Ariana Resources plc, continued
The Salinbas project has an inferred resource of 1.5Moz Au and the company is drilling at the Artvin gold project
to develop an understanding of that area.
In Cyprus, Ariana holds a 50% stake in Venus Minerals and the associated joint venture development of the
permitted Apliki coper-gold mine. Venus Minerals are planning a London listing on AIM. Ariana has a 75% stake
in West Tethyan Resources (WTR), who have a focus on southeastern Europe and are developing licences
primarily in Kosovo. During the year a strategic agreement was signed with Newmont who will invest US$2.5m to
develop  an  Exploration  Alliance  Agreement  via  WTR  focusing  on  copper  and  gold  in  Bosnia  and
Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Greece, Kosovo, North Macedonia and Serbia running for an initial five-year term.
Ariana's Asgard Metals fund has made investments in Australia-focused Panther Metals, Kazakhstan-focused
Pallas Resources and Indochina-focused Annamite Resources.
Significant activities since year end: Ariana Resources reported that gold production at the Kiziltepe mine was in
line with guidance and drilling was completed which was testing extensions of the vein system near mine.
Geophysical programmes are also underway to further aid near mine exploration. Construction of a second mine
at Tavsan is underway and the company has released an increase in JORC compliant resource for the Tavsan
project of 6.6Mt at 1.44g/t Au and 5.6g/t Ag for 307,000oz Au and 1.1M oz Ag, a 22% increase on the previous
resource.
Alba Mineral Resources plc (www.albamineralresources.com)
Alba Mineral Resource is a diversified mineral exploration company focused on oil and gas, gold and base metals
with holdings in UK (oil and gas, gold) and Ireland (base metals).
The company focused activities on its UK gold projects during the year, acquiring 100% of the Clogau property,
continuing with drill programmes at the historical mine site and also testing material from a waste tip on site at
Clogau in a pilot plant. The company’s application to dewater the Llechfraith Shaft was rejected by Natural
Resources Wales but Alba have submitted additional supporting data and analysis and have extended the
programme  of  ecological  and  species  surveys.  Regional  exploration,  with  a view  to  near-mine  resource
expansion, is also continuing, with an application for an unmanned aeromagnetic survey following up on
geochemical surveys carried out in 2019.
The Company’s UK oil and gas investments at Horse Hill, where they hold a 11.8% stake, remains ongoing with
production licences moving through legal channels and a Production Permit granted by the Environment Agency
in May 2022.
The Company’s Irish base metal licences have been extended through to May 2024, where they have three
principal target areas for follow-up drilling.
Alba holds a 54% majority interest in AIM-listed GreenRoc Mining plc, which the company spun out in September
2021. GreenRoc hold licences for graphite, black sands iron and multi-elements in Greenland and announced a
maiden JORC resource at its Amitsoq graphite deposit in March 2022 of 8.28Mt at 19.8% graphitic carbon. A
revised resource at the Thule Black Sands now stands at 19Mt at 8.9% in-situ ilmenite.
With a reported £2 million in cash at its interim report at the end of May 2022 the company is well-funded to move
forward this year.
Significant activities since year end: The company spun out GreenRoc to advance its Greenland graphite project.
Metallurgical test work showed that the material could potentially be used in the electric vehicle battery market.
In addition, the company appointed an adviser to assist in processing, sales and marketing going forward. On its
own projects, primarily the Clogau gold project in Wales, the company has appointed a gold supply chain expert
and completed a £0.5m placing in November.

"Как появилась звезда Мишлен? Французская компания Michelin, основанная в 1889 году братьями Андре и Эдуардом Мишлен, прославилась производством шин для автомобилей. Однако бизнес, связанный с производством шин, потребовал необычных маркетинговых решений для привлечения внимания к автотуризму, который тогда только зарождался. Чтобы стимулировать автомобилистов к путешествиям, в 1900 году компания начала выпускать красный гид Мишлен — справочник, который содержал полезную информацию для водителей, включая карты дорог, заправочные станции, гостиницы и рестораны. Спустя годы руководство Michelin заметило, что рестораны становятся все более важной частью путешествий. В 1926 году появилась первая звезда Мишлен, которая была введена для выделения ресторанов с отличной кухней. В 1931 году система была усовершенствована, и появился трехзвездочный рейтинг."

The assets' residual value and useful lives are reviewed, and adjusted if required, at each balance sheet date. The carrying amount of an asset is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the carrying amount is greater than its estimated recoverable amount.:
The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.

PRINCIPAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES:
Risk: Dependence on key personnel and employees, Potential Risk Description: The continued success of the Group depends partly upon the performance and expertise of its current and future key executives and personnel. A lack of skilled workforce could result in a drop in service levels and customer dissatisfaction, and therefore have an adverse impact on the Group in terms of its reputation. The loss of such individuals, or the failure to train and attract other high calibre individuals may impact on the Group's business and the Group's ability to achieve its targets., Mitigating Factors: The Group ensures all its employees are supported and managed by way of regular performance appraisals. Furthermore, the Group incentivises key employees using performance-related bonus plans and share option awards that vest over a multi-year period.
Risk: Competitive industry dynamics, Potential Risk Description: The Group operates in a highly complex and rapidly changing industry. If the Group is not able to compete successfully against existing or future competitors, its competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected., Mitigating Factors: The Board believes the Group has adopted a competitive business strategy to increase the profits of the business. The Group has implemented an acquisitive business model to improve its capabilities and scale within the markets which it operates. Furthermore, the Group maintains a substantial net cash position to provide flexibility in the event of a more competitive and less profitable trading environment.
Risk: Dependence on the operating policies of key platforms, Potential Risk Description: The Group generates a significant proportion of its revenue from three international technology platforms which are subject to external factors beyond the Group's control. Changes to the commercial agreements or policies implemented by these platforms could have a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group has diversified its business model away from the advertising platforms, which now only account for 38% (FY21: 66%) of the Group's revenues. Furthermore, the Group has diversified its revenues between three platforms to reduce the impact of any single platform policy change.
Risk: Impact of Pandemics, Potential Risk Description: A pandemic could cause an adverse impact on the Group's financial position. Customer marketing budgets could reduce, which may result in lower revenues. The Group's employees may be unable to service customers due to sickness or disruption to the Group's operations., Mitigating Factors: The Group operates a robust hybrid working system where its employees are not normally required to be physically present in an office in order to deliver work for customers.
Risk: Foreign Currency Risk, Potential Risk Description: The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange movements in the US dollar. These movements could result in a negative impact on the financial position of the Group., Mitigating Factors: The Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposure. All gains and losses are recognised in the income statement on translation at the reporting date.

On Telegram for Android, tap the message and select Report from the menu. On iOS, press and hold the message. On Telegram Desktop, Web or Telegram for macOS, right-click the message and select Report. Then choose an appropriate reason."
"11. Каков порядок приема на работу согласно ТК РФ? Прием на работу осуществляется путем заключения трудового договора, издания приказа о приеме на работу и внесения записи в трудовую книжку."
"21. Какие виды рабочего времени существуют по ТК РФ? Виды рабочего времени включают нормальную продолжительность, сокращенную, неполное рабочее время и сверхурочную работу."
"

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets and goodwill to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.:
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.

"
"

4.13. Financial Instruments:
Recognition and derecognition
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised with the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. Financial assets are derecognised when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire, or when the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards are transferred. A financial liability is derecognised when it is extinguished, discharged, cancelled or expires.
Loan and other receivables
The Group accounts for loan and other receivables by recording the loss allowance as lifetime expected credit losses. These are shortfalls in contractual cash flows, considering the potential for default at any point during the life of the financial instrument. The Group uses its historical experience, external indicators and forward-looking information to calculate expected credit losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method.
Contract assets and liabilities
The Group does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component if the entity expects, at contract inception, that the period between when the entity transfers a promised good or service to a customer and when the customer pays for that good or service will be one year or less.

"You can set a public username on Telegram. It then becomes possible for other users to find you by that username – you will appear in search under global results. Please note that people who find you will be able to send you messages, even if they don't know your number. If you are not comfortable with this, we advise against setting a username on Telegram. You can set up a username in Settings and use the universal search box in the chat list to search for chats, messages, and usernames.

What are Collectible Usernames? How are they different from basic usernames?"
"

4.15. Cash and cash equivalents:
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, together with other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into known amounts of cash having maturities of 3 months or less from inception and which are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value, and bank overdrafts.

"
"

Outlook:
We are mindful of macroeconomic challenges over the next 12-18 months, but have confidence in the prevailing trend that continues to shift marketing budgets away from traditional advertising and into digital channels. Furthermore, our position in this expanding marketplace is differentiated and growing from strength-to-strength.
This organic growth will be compounded by our carefully considered Acquisition & Integration strategy that has proven successful to date. Our Leadership Team is both capable and focussed, and we anticipate that the acquisition of Social Chain (completed in February 2023) will have a transformative impact on our ability to win and deliver for customers in the social media advertising space.

Executive Chairman

"How are secret chats different? Secret chats are meant for people who want more secrecy than the average fella. All messages in secret chats use end-to-end encryption. This means only you and the recipient can read those messages — nobody else can decipher them, including us here at Telegram (more on this here). On top of this, Messages cannot be forwarded from secret chats. And when you delete messages on your side of the conversation, the app on the other side of the secret chat will be ordered to delete them as well. You can order your messages, photos, videos and files to self-destruct in a set amount of time after they have been read or opened by the recipient. The message will then disappear from both your and your friend's devices. All secret chats in Telegram are device-specific and are not part of the Telegram cloud. This means you can only access messages in a secret chat from their device of origin. They are safe for as long as your device is safe in your pocket."
"

5.1. Critical accounting judgements:
Intangible assets and impairment
The Group recognises the intangible assets acquired as part of business combinations at fair value at the date of acquisition. The determination of these fair values is determined by experts engaged by management and based upon management's and the Directors' judgement and includes assumptions on the timing and amount of future incremental cash flows generated by the assets and selection of an appropriate discount rate. Furthermore management must estimate the expected useful lives of intangible assets and charge amortisation on these assets accordingly.
Trade receivables' recovery
Within trade debtors there is a balance of £0.7 million (2021: £0.7 million) which is over one year in age which the Group has judged it not necessary to provide for. This is because it believes it is recoverable, since there is a trade payable balance of £0.8 million (2021: £0.8 million) with the same company, and the Group is anticipating reaching agreement that these balances may be set off against each other.
Treatment of revenue as agent or principal

"If someone finds me by username, messages and I reply — will they know my number? No. Neither party will see another's phone number (unless this is permitted by your privacy settings). This is similar to the case when you message a person who you've met in a Telegram group."

You can change your number in Telegram and keep everything, including all your contacts, messages, and media from the Telegram cloud, as well as all your Secret Chats on all devices. To change your number, go to Settings, then tap on your phone number (just above the username), then click Change Number. If you already have a different Telegram account on the target number, you'll need to delete that account first."
"How is Telegram different from WhatsApp? Unlike WhatsApp, Telegram is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 2 GB each. Telegram needs less than 100 MB on your device – you can keep all your media in the cloud without deleting things – simply clear your cache to free up space. Thanks to Telegram's multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, it is faster and way more secure. On top of that, private messaging on Telegram is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever. Telegram's API and code is open, and developers are welcome to create their own Telegram apps. We also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for Telegram, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world."

Corporate governance statement:
The Board of Starvest plc are committed to the principles of good corporate governance and believe in the
importance  and  value  of  robust  corporate  governance  and  in  our  accountability  to  our  shareholders  and
stakeholders.
The AIM Rules for companies, updated in early 2018, required AIM companies to apply a recognised corporate
governance code from 28 September 2018. Starvest has chosen to adhere to the Quoted Company Alliance’s
Corporate Governance Code for Small and Mid-Size Quoted Companies (the “QCA Code”) and listed below are
the 10 broad principles of the QCA Code and the Company’s disclosure with respect to each point.
The Board recognises the importance of good governance, agrees to the principals set out in the QCA Code, and
is compliant with the vast majority of the QCA Code. However, the Company does not achieve full compliance
with the QCA Code; specifically, Principles 5 and 7. The areas of non-compliance will be readily addressed as the
Company grows and additional members are added to the Board.
The Board recognises that it is non-compliant with Principle 5 where the QCA Code recommends that at least two
directors are independent. The QCA Code requires that the boards of AIM companies have an appropriate balance
between executive and non-executive directors. The Board believes, at this time in the Company’s development
and with respect to the Company’s size and goals of achieving good shareholder value through preserving cash
for investment opportunities, that the positions within the Board are sufficient to carry out good corporate
governance with a balanced approach to decisions. As the Company grows this matter will be reviewed and
addressed with the goal of appointing additional board members and filling a non-executive, independent role.
The Board recognises that it does not fully comply with Principle 7 in that Starvest currently does not have formal
evaluation procedures for individual board members but the Board recognises that a formal evaluation process
may become necessary in the near future.
QCA CODE:
1: Establish a strategy and business model promoting long-term value for shareholders:
The Company is established as a source of early stage finance to fledgling businesses, to maximise the
capital value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and
modest dividends.
Investing strategy
Natural resources: Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the
Board sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were
generally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the
nature of the market has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio will include
companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the appropriate
financial backing, developing a commercial resource.
Direct Project: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target
companies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects
and subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct
project interests; those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be
operated by the investee company; Starvest will not manage any project. Prior to selling any projects to corporate
entities, Starvest may therefore have an interest in a number of projects. The addition of the Direct Project strategy
to the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual general meeting held
1 December 2017.
Investment size: Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies are invariably not
generating cash, but rather they have a constant need for additional funding in order to continue exploration and
development. Therefore, after appropriate due diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and
make later market purchases, so that the total investment may be greater than £100,000.

4.10. Development costs:
Expenditure on the research phase of an internal project is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• Completion of the asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale;
• The Group intends to complete the asset and use or sell it;
• The Group has the ability to use or sell the asset and the asset will generate probable future economic benefits (over and above cost);
• There are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset; and
• The expenditure attributable to the asset during its development can be measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria for capitalisation are expensed as incurred. The cost of an internally generated asset comprises all directly attributable costs necessary to create, produce and prepare the asset to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Directly attributable costs include employee (other than Director) costs incurred along with third party costs.

"? **Что такое потребительская корзина?**
	В 1992 году в России впервые составили перечень продуктов питания, промышленных товаров и услуг, необходимых человеку для удовлетворения базовых потребностей. Позже его назвали потребительской корзиной, а в 1999 году закрепили это понятие в законе. С тех пор ПК служит своеобразным ориентиром, к которым государство соотносит доходы населения, льготы и социальные выплаты. ПК помогает вести статистику в масштабах страны: сколько население должно потреблять и каковы реальные объёмы потребления."
"? **Что входит в состав потребительской корзины?**
	Потребительская корзина в РФ состоит из трёх компонентов.Первый - Продукты питания — 50 % от общей стоимости. второй - Непродовольственные товары —25 %. Третий - Услуги — 25 %. Продуктовая часть корзины — более тридцати наименований продуктов, объединённых в одиннадцать групп. Это хлебобулочные и мучные изделия, крупы, картофель, несколько основных видов овощей и фруктов, мясо, рыба, яйца, молочные продукты, сахар, растительные жиры и пр. Продукция посчитана в килограммах на год на одного человека. Пользуясь этими цифрами, можно посчитать, сколько чего нужно на месяц, рассчитать дневную норму потребления. Непродовольственная группа включает одежду, обувь, бельё, постельные принадлежности, хозтовары, лекарства и другие предметы первой необходимости. Они рассчитаны в штуках с учётом времени износа. В разделе услуг заложены расходы на оплату жилья, коммуналку (вода, электричество, газ, отопление), транспорт и пр. Каждые пять лет продуктовую корзину пересматривают. Это происходит не только потому, что растут цены. Меняется и её наполнение. По сравнению с 1999 годом в наборе жизненно необходимых товаров стало меньше растительных жиров и маргарина, хлеба, мучных изделий, картофеля, зато выросли нормы для молочных продуктов, фруктов и овощей, мяса, рыбы, яиц."

Corporate governance statement, continued
High risk: The business is inherently high risk and cyclical in nature dependent upon fluctuations in world
economic activity which impacts on the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the
opportunity to participate in diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for
significant returns for the foreseeable future.
Lack of liquidity: The investee companies, being small, almost invariably lack share market liquidity, even if they
are quoted on AIM, AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, in the early years it is rarely possible to sell an investment
at the quoted market price with the result that extreme patience is required whilst the investee company develops
and ultimately attracts market interest. If and when an explorer finds a large exploitable resource, it may become
the object of a third party bid, or otherwise become a much larger entity; either way an opportunity to realise cash
is expected to follow.
Success rate: Of the 15 to 20 investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove
to be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, the
expectation is that in time Shareholder returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is
unable to give any estimate of the quantum or timing of returns.
Profit distribution: When profits have been realised and adequate cash is available, it is the intention of the
Board to recommend the distribution of up to half the profits realised.
Other matters: The Company currently has investments in the following companies, which themselves are
investment companies: Equity Investors plc and Equity Resources Limited. The Company takes no part in the
active management of the companies in which it invests,
2: Seek to understand and meet shareholder needs and expectations
The Board recognises that it is accountable to Shareholders for the performance and activities of the Company
and to this end is committed to providing effective communication with the Shareholders of the Company.
Unpublished price sensitive information is disclosed in as timely a manner as possible and in accordance with
regulatory requirements for disclosure via a Regulatory Information Service provider.
Significant developments of investee companies are disseminated through stock exchange announcements and
by regularly updating the Company’s website, where descriptions of the investee company projects are available
and updated quarterly or whenever there is a significant event. In addition, copies of any research notes are
available.
The Board views the Annual General Meeting as an important forum for communication between the Company
and its Shareholders and encourages Shareholders to express their views on the Company’s business activities
and performance. Previous shareholder engagements at AGMs and other functions have been productive with
many questions answered by the Board. During other times of the year shareholder contact is primary through the
executive directors at investor events and via the company’s email: info@starvest.co.uk. Shareholder comments
or issues are disseminated to the Board and taken into account when reviewing the performance and development
of the Company.
The Board, through the Chief Executive Officer, the Executive Director and the Non-executive Chairman, also
maintains regular contact with its advisors in order to ensure that the Board develops an understanding of the
views of major Shareholders about the Company. The main point of shareholder contact is the CEO, Mr Mark
Badros,  and  the  other  Executive  Director,  Ms  Gemma  Cryan,  who  are  contactable  via  email  at
info@starvest.co.uk, by telephone +44 (0)2077 696 876, or in writing to the following address; Starvest plc, 33

Chairman’s Statement
I am pleased to present my annual statement to Shareholders for the year ended 30 September 2022 and the
twenty-second since the Company was formed in 2000.
Results for the year
The continuing impact of the global pandemic and the ongoing war in Eastern Europe and its effect on energy
supplies have dominated the financial news this year for Starvest and its portfolio companies. Starvest’s strategy
to steer its portfolio toward precious metal investments in recent years has enabled the Company to position itself
attractively for the current environment. Although improved investor sentiment boosted certain precious metal
stocks and those of certain other natural resource companies, gold prices declined 5.5% for the year ended 30
September 2022. The post-pandemic global economy and interest rate hikes, particularly in the US, have kept
prices flat recently but we continue to believe that there is a solid foundation for precious metals going forward.
Our investment portfolio decreased approximately 56% in the year to 30 September 2022 to £6 million. However,
the discount to net asset value narrowed by 5 percentage points, from 34% to 29% as at 30 September 2022,
which is a significant improvement for shareholders.
Greatland Gold plc (AIM:GGP) remains our primary investment, with its Havieron gold-copper discovery in
Australia. Havieron’s initial inferred resource increased from 4.2M oz gold equivalent* to 6.5M oz gold equivalent
during the year. The company secured funding through to production, expanded its board, and delivered
operational and financial improvements. While the share price has decreased over the last year, this is not
uncommon for a company in pre-production and we continue to see potential gains here.
Ariana Resources continues to expand its exploration and development footprint in Europe. As the Kiziltepe mine
has continued to meet production expectations, Ariana has focused on other projects in Turkey, such as Tavsan,
which is scheduled for first production in H2 2023. The alliance with Newmont, via its West Tethyan holding, allows
considerable scope to explore southeastern Europe over the next five years, and the recently acquired Kosovo
licence shows an interesting start to this US$2.5m agreement. Together with the Asgard Metals Fund, Ariana’s
exploration and development projects have expanded considerably since the company’s founding twenty years
ago.
Cora Gold continued to de-risk its Sanankoro project as it completed further drilling and increased its mineral
resource estimate by 14% while completing a feasibility study. After year-end the company announced that it had
received the Environmental Permit required for the project, a significant step forward.
We believe that the long-term outlook for gold prices remains favourable and we remain committed to our
strategy.

"How do I create a bot? Creating Telegram bots is super-easy, but you will need at least some skills in computer programming. If you're sure you're up to it, our Introduction for Developers is a good place to start. Unfortunately, there are no out-of-the-box ways to create a working bot if you are not a developer. But we're sure you'll soon find plenty of bots created by other people to play with."
"Collectible usernames work just like basic usernames, they appear in Global Search results and have their own links that can be used outside of Telegram: username.t.me. They can be bought and sold through third-party platforms like Fragment, giving a simple and secure way to acquire and exchange valuable Telegram domains. Acquiring a collectible username gives permanent ownership, verified by the TON blockchain. Owners of collectible usernames can freely assign them to chats, sell them to others, or keep them for later use.

What can I use as my username? You can use a-z, 0-9 and underscores. Usernames are case-insensitive, but Telegram will store your capitalization preferences (e.g. Telegram and TeleGram is the same user)."

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022
18.  Financial Instruments, continued
Credit Risk
The Company’s credit risk arises primarily from short term loans to related parties and the risk the counterparty
fails to discharge its obligations. At 30 September 2022 there were no loans outstanding (2021: £nil).
Liquidity Risk
Liquidity risk arises from the management of cash funds and working capital. The risk is that the Company will fail
to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Company operates within the constraints of available funds
and cash flow projections are produced and regularly reviewed by management.
Interest rate risk profile of financial assets
The only financial assets (other than short term debtors) are cash at bank and in hand, which comprises money
at call. The interest earned in the year was negligible. The Directors believe the fair value of the financial
instruments is not materially different to the book value.
Foreign currency risk
The Company has no material exposure to foreign currency fluctuations.
Market risk
The Company is exposed to market risk in that the value of its investments would be expected to vary depending
on trading activity of its shares.

The Group does not have an independent Chairman given the executive function of the Chairman. The Executive Chairman has a significant shareholding in the Company. The Group does not have a separate CEO and, where appropriate, the Executive Chairman assumes the role of CEO. While it is the Board's opinion that the current arrangements are appropriate to the Company at this stage of development the Board recognises the Code requirement on splitting the roles and will keep this under review. Meanwhile there are sufficient compliance structures within the Company to ensure that the governance functions that would be part of an independent Chairman's responsibility are met. The Executive Chairman will meet regularly with the Independent Directors to discuss the operation of the Board and strategy.:
The Board aims to convene 6 times a year, with additional meetings being held as required. Board meetings are a mix of virtual and in person.
Prior to their appointment, the Company informed each Director of the nature of their role, their responsibilities and duties to the Company, and the time commitment involved. On appointment, each Director confirmed that, taking into account all of their other commitments, they were able to allocate sufficient time to the Company to discharge their role effectively. The Board is satisfied that the Non-Executive Directors each devote sufficient time to the Company and that there have been no significant changes to their other commitments.

The determination of whether the Group is acting as a principal or an agent in a transaction involves judgment and is based on an assessment of who controls a specified good or service before it is transferred to a customer. Significant contracts are reviewed for the indicators of control. These include if the Group is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide the good or service, if the Group has inventory risk before the good or services has been transferred to the customer and if the Group has discretion in establishing the price for the good or service.:
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax assets are recognised in respect of tax loss carry forwards only to the extent that the realisation of the related tax benefit through future taxable profits is probable.
Greenlight acquisition and purchase price allocation
The purchase price allocation of the Greenlight acquisition was fully assessed in the year, within the one year IFRS 3 measurement period from the date of acquisition, and acquired intangibles were identified and a full valuation exercise carried out in relation to the Greenlight trade name and the customer relationships. The purchase price has been reallocated accordingly.
Best Response Media acquisition and purchase price allocation
The purchase price allocation of the Best Response Media acquisition was provisionally assessed, and the Group judged that at the interim valuation stage it was not able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. A full valuation exercise will be completed within the one year IFRS3 measurement period from the date of acquisition which may recognise additional intangible assets separately from goodwill.

The Group has recognised a provision for the costs to restore leased property to its original condition, as required by the terms and conditions of the lease. This is recognised when the obligation is incurred, either at the commencement date or as a consequence of having used the underlying asset during a particular period of the lease, at the directors' best estimate of the expenditure that would be required to restore the assets. Estimates are regularly reviewed and adjusted as appropriate for new circumstances.:
5 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements under UK adopted International Accounting Standards requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The estimates and assumptions which have a risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of assets and liabilities are discussed below.

Strategic report:
Principal activities and business review
Since the company’s inception in 2002, its principal trading activity has been to identify and, where appropriate,
support small company new issues, pre-IPO and ongoing fundraising opportunities with a view to realising profit
from disposals as the businesses mature in the medium term. The current directors have maintained this strategy
of seeking out investment opportunities in small-cap and pre-IPO mining and metals companies.
The Company’s investing policy is stated on page 3.
The Company’s key performance indicators and developments during the year are given in the Chairman’s
statement and in the trading portfolio review, all of which form part of the Directors’ & Strategic reports.
Finance Review
Over the 12 months to 30 September 2022 the Company recorded a loss before tax of £7,540,842, equating to a
loss of 12.96 pence per share with net cash inflow for the year of £327,830. This compares to a loss before tax of
£3,861,014 in the previous year that equated to a loss of 6.69 pence per share. The Company’s cash deposits
stood at £406,106 at the period end.
Key Performance Indicators
The Company’s key measure of performance is the market value of its investment holdings. As a secondary metric,
the Company seeks to manage the administrative and other expenses associated with achieving its investment
results. The Company does not have any operating activities and thus the directors take the opinion that analysis
using  operating  key  performance  indicators  is  not  necessary  for  an  understanding  of  the  performance,
development or position of the business at the present time.
Key risks and uncertainties
This business carries a high level of risk and uncertainty with commensurately high potential returns. The risk
arises from the very nature of early-stage mineral exploration where there can be no certainty of outcome. In
addition, often there is a lack of liquidity in the Company’s trading portfolio, even for securities quoted on AIM or
AQSE, such that the Company may have difficulty in realising the full value in an immediate or forced sale.
Accordingly, a commitment is only made after thorough research into both the management and the business of
the target, both of which are closely monitored thereafter. Furthermore, the Company limits the total size of any
single commitment, both as to the absolute amount and percentage ownership of the target company.
Section 172 Statement
Section 172 (1) of the Companies Act obliges the Directors to promote the success of the Company for the benefit
of the Company’s members as a whole. This section specifies that the Directors must act in good faith when
promoting the success of the Company and in doing so have regard (amongst other things) to:
a)  The likely consequences of any decision in the long term;
b)  The interests of the Company’s employees;
c)  The need to foster the Company’s business relationship with suppliers, customers and others;
d)  The impact of the Company’s operations on the community and environment;
e)  The desirability of the Company maintaining a reputation for high standards of business conduct; and
f)  The need to act fairly as between members of the Company.
The Board of Directors is collectively responsible for formulating the Company’s strategy, which is to invest in
businesses where prospects appear to be exceptional at an attractive price and deliver good risk-adjusted
investment returns to its shareholders. Since 1 October 2021, the Board took the decision to reduce its
concentration of risk in one project by divesting some of its position. The Board places equal importance on all
shareholders and strives for transparent and effective external communications, within the regulatory confined of
a listed company. The primary communication tool for regulatory matters and matters of material substance is
through the Regulatory News Service (“RNS”). We also provide an environment where shareholders can interact
with the Board and management, as questions and raise their

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC
Opinion
We have audited the financial statements of Starvest Plc (the ‘company’) for the year ended 30 September 2022
which comprise the Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Statement of Financial Position, the Statement of
Changes in Equity, the Statement of Cash Flows and notes to the financial statements, including significant
accounting policies. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards, including FRS 102 The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in
the UK and Republic of Ireland (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In our opinion, the financial statements:
-  give a true and fair view of the state of the company’s affairs as at 30 September 2022 and of its loss for
the year then ended;
-  have been properly prepared in accordance with United  Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice; and
-  have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK) (ISAs (UK)) and applicable
law. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit
of the financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the company in accordance with the ethical
requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in the UK, including the FRC’s Ethical
Standard as applied to listed entities, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with
these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide
a basis for our opinion.
Conclusions relating to going concern
In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Director's use of the going concern basis of
accounting  in  the  preparation  of  the  financial  statements  is  appropriate.  Our  evaluation  of  the  Directors’
assessment of the company’s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included a review
of the cash flow forecasts prepared by management, challenging the assumptions made therein and evaluating
the ability of the company to realise its Level 1 investments, if required, to meet its liabilities as they fall due.
Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or
conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the company's ability to continue as a
going concern for a period of at least twelve months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue.
Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the
relevant sections of this report.
Our application of materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. The quantitative and qualitative thresholds
for materiality determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures.
Materiality for the company financial statements was set at £184,000 (2021: £422,000). This was calculated based
on 3% of net assets, of which equity investments comprise the majority of the balance. The basis for calculating
materiality is unchanged from the previous year, with the reduction reflecting the fall in fair value of equity
investments at year-end. The benchmark used is the one which we determined, in our professional judgment, to
be the key benchmark within the financial statements relevant to shareholders of an investment management
company in assessing financial performance. The key driver of the company and assessment of its performance
is linked to the valuation of its equity investments held. Performance materiality has been set at £128,800 (2021:
£295,400) being 70% of headline materiality, based upon our assessment of risk and the absence of any audit
adjustments in previous periods.
We agreed to report to those charged with governance all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified
through our audit with a value in excess of £9,000 (2021: £21,100). We also agreed to report any other audit
misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

4.17. Share based payments:
Employees (including Directors) of the Group received remuneration in the form of share-based payment transactions, whereby employees render services in exchange for rights over shares ('equity-settled transactions'). The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-based payments to all grants of equity instruments. The transactions have been treated as equity settled.
The cost of equity settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the grant date of the equity instrument granted. The fair value is determined by using the Black-Scholes method. The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding charge to equity, over the period between the date of grant and the end of a vesting period, where relevant employees become fully entitled to the award. The total value of the options has been pro-rated and allocated on a weighted average basis.

At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its property, plant and equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.:
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Intangible assets
An intangible asset, which is an identifiable non-monetary asset without physical substance, is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the expected future economic benefits attributable to the asset will flow to the Group and that its cost can be measured reliably. The asset is deemed to be identifiable when it is separable or when it arises from contractual or other legal rights.
Intangible assets acquired as part of a business combination, are shown at fair value at the date of the acquisition less accumulated amortisation. Amortisation is charged on a straight line basis to profit or loss. The rates applicable, which represent the Directors' best estimate of the useful economic life, are:
• Customer relationships – 5 to 10 years
• Online channel content – 3 to 5 years
• Brands – 3 years
• Technology – 1 to 5 years

Территория РФ поделена на десять зон, и в каждой из них своя потребительская корзина. К примеру, на севере страны выше потребление жиров, поскольку на холоде нужно больше энергоёмкой пищи. В приморских регионах едят больше рыбы, на юге — овощей и фруктов. В мусульманских регионах в мясной группе продуктов преобладает говядина и баранина, и почти нет свинины. Есть разница и в наполнении корзины непродовольственными товарами и услугами (покупка одежды и обуви, оплата коммунальных услуг и т.п.). В холодных климатических зонах их потребление на 15–20 % выше, чем в регионах с тёплым и умеренным климатом."

Company statistics
The Company considers the following statistics to be its Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and is satisfied with
the results achieved in the year given the uncertain market conditions.
30 September 2022: 30 September 2021: Изменение (%)
Trading portfolio value: £6.2 m: £14.0 m: -55.7%
Company net asset value: £6.6 m: £14.1 m: -53.2%
Net asset value per share: 11.3 p: 24.4 p: -53.7%
Closing share price: 8.0 p: 16.0 p: -50%
Share price discount to net asset value: 29%: 34%: 5 п.п.
Market capitalisation: £4.7 m: £9.3 m: -49.5%
Since the fiscal year end, values have improved. As at the close of business on 31 December 2022 the Company’s
Net Asset Value was £7.1m.
Review of the current market
Global markets and gold prices fluctuated throughout the year; with economies and governments trying to
rebalance and adjust to continuing post-pandemic and energy related uncertainties.
The price of gold fluctuated throughout the year with a peak of US$1,998 per troy ounce in March 2022 and a low
of US$1,629 in September 2022 but has remained at elevated prices relative to the last decade. Copper, nickel,
lead and zinc are all down year on year based on inflation and forecasted recessions.
Overall, investors are demonstrating greater interest in the natural resources sector, as the market looks forward
to economic growth, ‘green’ technology investments, and further government stimulus via major infrastructure
projects; long-term natural resources are still vital commodities and demand is forecast to increase.
The current market conditions allow for measured, strategic investment in undervalued, early-stage natural
resource projects.

5.2. Estimates:
Share based payment charges
The Group is required to measure the fair value of its share based payments. The fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes method which requires assumptions regarding exchange rate volatility, the risk free rate, share price volatility and the expected life of the share based payment. Exchange rate volatility is calculated using historic data over the past three years. The volatility of the Group's share price has been calculated as the average of similar listed companies over the preceding periods. The risk-free rate range used is between 0% and 1.25% and management, including the Directors, have estimated the expected life of most share based payments to be 4 years.
Bad debt provision
Recoverability of some receivables may be doubtful although not definitely irrecoverable. Where management feel recoverability is in doubt an appropriate provision is made for the possibility that the amounts may not be recovered in full. Provisions are made using past experience however subjectivity is involved when assessing the level of provision required.

Statement of directors' responsibilities
Directors' responsibilities for the financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Directors’ report, the strategic report and the financial statements
in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the
Directors have elected to prepare financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of
the state of affairs and profit or loss of the company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the
Directors are required to:
-  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
-  make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
-  state whether applicable UK accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
-  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the
company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Company is compliant with AIM Rule 26 regarding the Company’s website.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued
We have nothing to report in this regard.
Opinions on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion, based on the work undertaken in the course of the audit:
-  the information given in the strategic report and the directors’ report for the financial year for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements; and
-  the strategic report and the directors’ report have been prepared in accordance with applicable legal
requirements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
In the light of the knowledge and understanding of the company and its environment obtained in the course of the
audit, we have not identified material misstatements in the strategic report or the directors’ report.
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters in relation to which the Companies Act 2006 requires
us to report to you if, in our opinion:
-  adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
-  the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
-  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
-  we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.
Responsibilities of directors
As explained more fully in the statement of directors’ responsibilities, the directors are responsible for the
preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view, and for such
internal control as the directors determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are
free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, the directors are responsible for assessing the company’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless the directors either intend to liquidate the company or to cease operations, or have no realistic
alternative but to do so.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or
error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures
in line with our responsibilities, outlined above, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities,
including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud is
detailed below:
-  We obtained an understanding of the company and the sector in which it operates to identify laws and
regulations that could reasonably be expected to have a direct effect on the financial statements. We
obtained our understanding in this regard through discussions with management and application of cu-
mulative audit knowledge.

Review of trading portfolio:
Introduction
During the year to 30 September 2022, the portfolio comprised interests in the companies discussed below, as
well as other active companies that are not discussed herein.
The economic shock of the global pandemic continued throughout 2022 and investors’ desire for traditional safe-
haven assets boosted precious metals stocks at times. However, supply chain issues and European conflict led
to rising energy prices, broader-based inflation and a shift in economic policies which caused market reactions
and precious metal price fluctuations as well as an overall decline year on year in metal prices when forecasts for
growth were downgraded. In this environment, we believe our strategy to focus on investments in gold producers
will prove to be rewarding on a risk-adjusted basis for our shareholders. However, during the year to 30 September
2022, the value of our trading portfolio decreased ~56% due to lower market prices for major positions. Including
our cash position, our net asset value (“NAV”) and NAV per share decreased 53.4% and 53.7%, respectively, over
the 12-month period to 30 September 2022. Given that Starvest’s market capitalisation decreased approximately
49%, the discount to NAV narrowed to 29% compared to 34% a year ago.
Transactions
During the year the Company did not raise capital through placing or subscription.
The Company disposed of its full holdings in Minera IRL during the year, along with a small portion of its positions
in Greatland Gold (3.8m shares at an average price of 12.83p per share) and Ariana Resources (2.2m shares at
an average price of 4.25p per share).
Trading portfolio valuation
Although gold prices declined slightly (~5%) year on year, this change masked greater volatility during the 12-
month period. The Company’s Net Asset Value decreased approximately 53% during the year to 30 September
2022 to £6.6m and the Company made a loss before tax of £7,540,842 compared with a loss before tax of
£3,861,014 in 2021.
However, we are pleased that the Company traded at an improved discount to its NAV of 29% compared to 34%
the previous year.
As part of routine operations, the Board regularly reviews its portfolio positions and may make adjustments to its
holdings to take advantage of what  it  believes to  be temporary weakness in prices for precious metals.
Alternatively, the Board may consider strategic opportunities to better align the Company’s stock price with what
it regards as the intrinsic value of the Company’s portfolio.
Given the availability of actual trading prices for many of our portfolio assets, we value our holdings using closing
market quotes for the periods shown.
In addition, the Company believes it has a strong financial position as it has no outstanding debt and is well-
positioned to benefit from further strength in the natural resources sector through its exposure to early-stage
precious metal producers. We believe that worldwide economic growth and increasingly affluent consumers will
fuel demand for motor cars, air conditioning, consumer goods, computers, together with materials required in
switching to ‘greener’ technologies and other items that require the development and exploitation of natural
resources in order both to produce and power.

Depreciation is calculated to write down the cost less estimated residual value of all property, plant and equipment by equal annual instalments over their expected useful lives less estimated residual values, using the straight line method. The rates generally applicable are:
• Fixtures & Fittings – 3 years or over remaining lease term
• Computer Equipment – 3 years
The gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.

"What's the difference between groups and channels? Telegram groups are ideal for sharing stuff with friends and family or collaboration in small teams. But groups can also grow very large and support communities of up to 200,000 members. You can make any group public, toggle persistent history to control whether or not new members have access to earlier messages and appoint administrators with granular privileges. You can also pin important messages to the top of the screen so that all members can see them, including those who have just joined. Channels are a tool for broadcasting messages to large audiences. In fact, a channel can have an unlimited number of subscribers. When you post in a channel, the message is signed with the channel's name and photo and not your own. Each message in a channel has a view counter that gets updated when the message is viewed, including its forwarded copies."

4.6. Leasing:
For any new contracts entered into on or after 1 January 2019, the Group considers whether a contract is, or contains a lease. A lease is defined as 'a contract, or part of a contract, that conveys the right to use an asset (the underlying asset) for a period of time in exchange for consideration'. To apply this definition the Group assesses whether the contract meets three key evaluations which are whether:
• The contract contains an identified asset, which is either explicitly identified in the contract or implicitly specified by being identified at the time the asset is made available to the Group;
• The Group has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from use of the identified asset throughout the period of use, considering its rights within the defined scope of the contract;
• The Group has the right to direct the use of the identified asset throughout the period of use. The Group assess whether it has the right to direct 'how and for what purpose' the asset is used throughout the period of use.
At lease commencement date, the Group recognises a right‑of-use asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet. The right-of-use asset is measured at cost, which is made up of the initial measurement of the lease liability, any initial direct costs incurred by the Group, an estimate of any costs to dismantle and remove the asset at the end of the lease, and any lease payments made in advance of the lease commencement date (net of any incentives received).
The Group depreciates the right-of-use assets on a straight-line basis from the lease commencement date to the earlier of the end of the useful life of the right-of-use asset or the end of the lease term. The Group also assesses the right-of-use asset for impairment when such indicators exist.
At the commencement date, the Group measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments unpaid at that date, discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease if that rate is readily available or the Group's incremental borrowing rate.
Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability are made up of fixed payments (including in substance fixed), variable payments based on an index or rate, amounts expected to be payable under a residual value guarantee and payments arising from options reasonably certain to be exercised.
Subsequent to initial measurement, the liability will be reduced for payments made and increased for interest. It is remeasured to reflect any reassessment or modification, or if there are changes in in-substance fixed payments.
When the lease liability is remeasured, the corresponding adjustment is reflected in the right-of-use asset, or profit and loss if the right-of-use is already reduced to zero.

Cora Gold Limited (www.coragold.com)
The company’s exploration and development activities have continued in Mali on its flagship Sanankoro project.
The company completed a drill programme converting additional ounces from the inferred to indicated category,
increasing the total Mineral Resource Estimate by 14% and the oxide Indicated Minerals Resource by 22% in July
2022. Sanankoro comprises 24.9Mt of material grading at 1.15g/t Au of which 16.1Mt are indicated and 8.7Mt are
inferred for a total 920koz Au.
Drilling also identified two new mineralised areas in close proximity to the existing resource at Sanankoro and the
company carried out field work on a number of its other permits in southern Mali. The ongoing feasibility study for
Sanankoro is due to be completed by Q4 2022.
With $2m in cash reported at the end of June 2022 in its unaudited interim report and funding agreements in place,
the company is a good position to move forward with mine development over the next year.
Significant  activities  since  year  end:  Cora  announced  in  mid-October  2022  that  it  had  been  granted  the
Environmental Permit for mining at its flagship Sanankoro project. The project’s JORC Exploration Target was
released in late November and contain between 26 and 35.2Mt Au with grades between 0.58 and 1.21g/t Au for
potentially 490-1,370k oz Au. This is in addition to the indicated and inferred mineral resource of 24.9Mt at 1.15g/t
Au for 920koz. The Exploration Target consists of 90% oxide and transitional material.
The company released a maiden reserve and definitive feasibility study in late November. Figures were based on
a gold price of $1,650/oz Au providing 10.1Mt at 1.3g/t Au for 422koz Au, with 90% recovery rate.  Optimised DFS
economics were based on $1,750/oz Au giving a 6.8 year mine life, 1.2 year payback period, 52.3% IRR, $997/oz
AISC, 56,000oz pa average production. $234m free cash flow over life of mine.
Regional exploration has also continued with over 9km of gold structures identified from three separate zones.
Grab samples of up to 6g/t Au have been reported and future reconnaissance drilling is planned.
Oracle Power plc (www.oraclepower.co.uk)
Oracle Power was originally focused on developing and operating a coal mine and a power plant in Pakistan and
while those are still progressing it has recently diversified into green energy technology and gold projects.
In January 2022, Oracle signed a MoU with Aui Southern Gas Company Ltd, a company listed on the Pakistan
Stock Exchange, relating to the buyback and joint development of a synthetic natural gas project using Thar
Block VI coal.
In October 2021 the company signed a non-exclusive cooperation agreement with PowerChina International
Group to jointly develop a green hydrogen production facility in Pakistan, targeting a 400MW capacity plant. An
update in December 2021 stated that a preliminary technical study was completed by PowerChina, establishing
key technical and commercial aspects, targeting a 400MW capacity hydrogen plant with planned hydrogen
production of 150,000kg per day. Technology suppliers were being sought and negotiations were underway with
provincial governments regarding infrastructure. In March 2022 the company entered a joint venture agreement
with His Highness Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum (represented through Kaheel Energy) on the project and
established (a joint venture company), Oracle Energy. Oracle raised £800,000 in April 2022 and a further
£500,000 in August 2022 toward the project and an MoU was signed with Nuvera Fuel Cells LLC in June 2022
to jointly oversee a pilot hydrogen bus project. Oracle has also entered into an MoU with a hydrogen storage
company in China to jointly explore storage and infrastructure development.
In addition to its Pakistan projects, Oracle continued to develop its Australia gold projects with drilling and
metallurgical test work on samples from its Western Australia ground.
Significant activities since year end: Oracle has continued to focus on the green hydrogen project in Pakistan. It
appointed Thyssenkruoo Uhde to lead a technical and commercial feasibility study for the project and signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with Blue Carbon to collaborate on a decarbonisation roadmap.

Corporate governance statement, continued
3: Take into account wider stakeholder and social responsibilities and their implications for long-term
success.
The Board recognises that the success of the Company is reliant on the stakeholders of the business and, to this
effect, the Company engages with these stakeholder groups, both internal and external on a regular basis.
The Company’s strategy to investment immediately prior to an initial public offering, on AIM or AQSE dictates that
we foster good relationships with broking firms, other professional service providers to the natural resource
industry and members of mining and exploration companies in order to keep abreast of potential investment
opportunities.
The Company engages with numerous established broking firms and a network of professionals within the natural
resource industry to keep abreast of new companies and investment opportunities becoming available. The
company deals only with ethically sound entities and, as such, reduces any risk to investment capital by unethical
business practices.
Investee companies and potential investee companies are reviewed with respect to country and community
commitments to social and environmental responsibility. It is the company’s belief that a good CSR (corporate
social responsibility) policy enhances an investee company’s standing and thus progress of a project/resource on
a local, regional and government scale.
Investment by the Company in resource projects generally brings positive benefits to local communities who gain
from employment, improved infrastructure and access to health facilities.
4:  Embed  effective  risk  management,  considering  both  opportunities  and  threats  throughout  the
organisation
The business is inherently high risk and of a cyclical nature dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity
which impacts on the demand for minerals. However, it offers the investor a spread of investments in an exciting
sector, which the Board believes will continue to offer the potential of significant returns for the foreseeable future.
Through the Board’s collective industry experience and thorough research and investigation into potential
investments, including but not limited to: geological setting, board and management experience, financial plans,
jurisdictional risk and market conditions both current and forecast; we strive to minimise the inherent risks yet still
avail of opportunities that will deliver good returns on investment capital in the medium to long term. The Company
maintains an Audit Committee and Remuneration Committee with each reporting directly to the Board. Each
Committee comprises one Executive Director and one Non-Executive Director.
The Company maintains a risk register that identifies key risks in the areas of corporate strategy, and finances as
well as a comprehensive register for assessing investment opportunities. The register is reviewed periodically and
updated as and when necessary. If there are any significant changes to the trading environment then the register
is reviewed and updated as required.
Within the scope of the annual audit, specific financial risks are evaluated in detail, including in relation to foreign
currency, liquidity and credit.
5: Maintain the board as a well-functioning, balanced team led by the chair

On the 28 April 2022, the Group acquired the entire issued share capital of Best Response Media Limited. The consideration was financed by existing cash balances. Best Response Media Limited is a specialist ecommerce and mobile development company focused exclusively on the Adobe Commerce Platform.
The provisional fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were as follows:
: Goodwill, Book value £000's: 239, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 239
: Tangible Assets, Book value £000's: 1, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1

: Current Liabilities, Book value £000's: (143), Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: (143)
: , Book value £000's: 1,174, Fair value adjustments £000's: -, Fair value £000's: 1,174
The consideration for the acquisition was as follows:
: Initial cash consideration – paid, £000's: 962
: Completion accounts adjustment – paid, £000's: 37
: Deferred cash consideration – paid, £000's: 175
: , £000's: 1,174
The consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income includes £0.1 million of acquisition costs in relation to Best Response Media Limited.
The fair value of the financial assets includes trade and other receivables with a fair value of £0.2 million and a gross contractual value of £0.3 million. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash flows not to be collected is £0.1 million. The goodwill represents the acquired accumulated workforce and the synergies expected from integrating Best Response Media into the Group's existing business. The Group has carried out an interim fair value adjustment exercise and will be completing a full exercise within the one year measurement period from the date of the acquisition in accordance with IFRS3. At the interim valuation stage the Group has not been able to reliably estimate the fair value of acquired intangibles and therefore the excess of consideration over fair value of other identifiable assets and liabilities has been allocated to goodwill. Once the full valuation exercise has been completed additional intangible assets may be recognised separately from goodwill.
Best Response Media Limited contributed £0.5 million revenue and £0.2 million loss to the Group's profit for the period between the date of acquisition and the reporting date.
If the acquisition of Best Response Media Limited had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have been £32 million and Group profit would have been £1.9 million.
30 Post balance sheet events
On the 3 February 2023 the Group announced the purchase of 100% of the issued share capital of Social Chain Limited. The initial consideration for the acquisition consisted of a payment of £7.7m. This was partially funded by way of an oversubscribed vendor placing to raise £4.75 million. Social Chain is one of the UK's leading social media and influencer marketing agencies. The completion balance sheet in relation to the acquisition is still being prepared, and therefore a breakdown of the assets and liabilities acquired has not been disclosed.

"Does Telegram send Verification Codes for other apps? Telegram allows third-party services to send verification codes to their users via Telegram. These codes only appear in the verified Verification Codes chat, and let you tap to instantly copy the code.If you receive a code in the Verification Codes chat, it's probably because you requested to log in to a third-party service, like an external website, app or marketplace.

ENVIRONMENTAL:
As a digital media, digital advertising and technology services group, the direct and indirect impact of the Group on the environment is low. Nevertheless, we continue to aim to reduce our environmental impact.
Our sustainability strategy has 3 pillars, emissions, waste & recycling and consumables.
Carbon emissions:
As a service business our energy use is by far our biggest contributor to our carbon emissions. Combined, electricity and gas represent around 70% of emissions in a normal (non-pandemic) year. We encourage energy saving with simple but effective office measures.
The most important of these is our pledge to offset actual carbon emissions or the highest year of emissions – providing a direct incentive to staff to save energy, since any reduction below our worst year translates into the business being carbon negative. This is critical and, we believe, unique, as it removes the implicit ""permission to emit"" that carbon offsetting programmes can otherwise create.
Carbon Emissions are classified as Scope 1, 2 or 3. Scope 1 includes direct emissions from burning fossil fuels, Scope 2 is made up of indirect emissions that a company is directly responsible for, such as burning fossil fuels for electricity and emissions from public transport made on company business, and Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that the company is indirectly responsible for. Scope 3 is wide and includes emissions from cloud computing, emissions associated with the manufacture of office equipment and much more.
Our Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions are measured in the first half of each year for the prior year. We partner with specialist consultants Carbon Footprint Ltd to assess and verify our footprint. The assessment includes rigorous estimates of the impact of our people working from home, which they now do a significant proportion of the time. From this year we intend our reports will cover the entirety of Scope 3 emissions, making 2022 the first year a complete and unflinching benchmark of our Carbon Footprint has been made.
Our offsetting programme is a blend of avoided deforestation (REDD) in the Amazon, reforesting in Africa, UK tree planting, and clean cooking technology in rural China and India (where wood and coal burning is otherwise prevalent). Finally, we plant 15 trees for every new client win or renewed client contract in our Tree Nation forest.
As our measurement to date has been for Scopes 1, 2 and part of Scope 3, we only claim Scope 1 & 2 carbon neutrality (or carbon negativity in years where our offsetting is greater than our emissions). Following 2022's Carbon Footprint assessment which we expect to be complete by the end of May, it's our ambition to make a Net Zero commitment in line with the Science Based Targets Initiative, accompanied by a plan to reach Net Zero across all scopes.
Other measures include automatic timers on our TV's and communication with our staff about the impact their energy use has. Travel was significantly reduced as a result of COVID-19, and the Group continues to minimise travel where possible.
Waste & Recycling
The Group operates a largely paperless office. All employees are advised that documents and emails should not be printed, instead accessed via shared digital drives. When required, printers are set to double-sided and black and white, the aim being to reduce the use of both paper and toner.
We have long been a Group that aims to recycle as much waste as possible. We have clearly labelled recycling points stationed around the offices, and avoid bins at desks to encourage their use.
Consumables
We have an ongoing programme designed to minimise the environmental impact of our consumption beyond greenhouse gases and recycling.
Livestock farming generates a significant percentage of global greenhouse gas emissions, with red meat and dairy producing the majority of this. A third of the water used for farming goes toward rearing farm animals. Soy and oat milk alternatives are provided, again reducing our dairy farming impact while avoiding water intensive almond milk. From this year, our ambition is to stop the routine purchase of any meat in food bought for staff and clients, with exceptions only for special events and requests.
We have removed all plastic bottled water from our London office and installed fresh still and sparkling water taps instead, avoiding over 600 single use plastic bottles every month.
Lastly, we only buy 100% recycled paper for our office printers.

Principal Activities:
Brave Bison has two business models.
Firstly, the provision of digital advertising and technology services to global blue-chip companies. Services provided include social media advertising, influencer marketing, paid media services, search engine optimisation services, ecommerce software integration, ecommerce system design and others. Customers include New Balance, Muller, Primark and Asus. This operation is referred to as ""fee based services"" in the Group segmental reporting.
The digital advertising and technology services business unit showed good growth during the year. Revenues increased by 169% to £19.7 million (2021: £7.3 million) and the gross profit approximately tripled to £14.0 million (2021: £4.8 million). In line with our acquisition and integration strategy, Greenlight Digital was integrated into Brave Bison Performance, and Greenlight Commerce and Best Response Media were integrated into Brave Bison Commerce.
Secondly, Brave Bison owns and operates a network of social and digital media channels. These channels principally exist on platforms such as YouTube, Snapchat, Facebook, TikTok and Instagram. Brave Bison publishes content on these channels which attract views and serve advertising which can be bought programmatically through digital advertising platforms. This operation is referred to as ""advertising"" in Group segmental reporting.
The advertising business unit generated revenue of £11.9 million (2021: £14.3 million) and approximately 1.3 billion views (2021: 1.7 billion). This decrease year-on-year largely relates to channels that are operated but not owned by Brave Bison on a revenue share basis, therefore the underlying gross profit remained broadly flat at £2.9 million (2021: £3.0 million). The small drop in gross profit was largely due to a softening of CPMs (cost per mille) in the second half of the year in response to macro-economic conditions. As we saw during the pandemic, this part of our business can be sensitive to such conditions, but tends to recover swiftly.
""2022 was a year of healthy growth at Brave Bison""
Margins & Operations
Brave Bison tracks adjusted profit margin (adjusted profit before tax as a percentage of gross profit) as a key performance indicator to measure the Group's financial performance.
The adjusted profit margin for the period was 15.4% (2021: 17.9%) a decrease year-on-year. This decrease was driven by the tripling of digital advertising and technology services net revenues which operates at a lower adjusted profit margin than advertising generated on the media network.
Despite the decrease in adjusted profit margin, Brave Bison has completed a number of initiatives to reduce the underlying operating costs of the business. These include a reduction in property costs through sub-letting excess office space, reduction in IT costs as business units are merged and careful resource management to reduce the staff cost to net revenue ratio for billable customers.
Exceptional Costs & Adjustments
During the year Brave Bison incurred restructuring costs of £0.1 million (2021:£0.2 million), relating to the restructuring and expansion of the Group's operations in Bulgaria, and acquisition costs of £0.1 million (2021: £0.7 million) relating to the costs associated with acquiring Best Response Media.
Brave Bison carried out a purchase price allocation exercise during the year in relation to the Greenlight acquisitions which completed in 2021, which resulted in identification of intangible assets relating to the acquired brands and customer relationships. As a result of the rebranding, and retirement of the Greenlight trade brand during the year, the amounts relating to this were impaired in full during the year, resulting in an impairment charge of £0.5 million (2021: £nil). The customer relationships are being amortised over a period of 10 years, resulting in a charge of £0.2 million (2021: £nil). As we deliver on our acquisition and integration strategy it is likely that both the amortisation of acquired intangibles, and impairment of acquired brands retired post-integration will continue to impact our financial statements.
Equity settled share-based payments relate to the value of share awards that have been granted to employees of the Group. £0.3 million of this amount relates to the directors' LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report. The earliest possible redemption date is December 2024, and redemption is contingent on the share price exceeding 3.0 pence.
Adjusted EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure that the Group uses to measure its performance and is defined as earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortisation and after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions and share based payments. It should be noted that a portion of the property costs in both 2022 and 2021 fall into the finance costs and depreciation lines as a result of the introduction of IFRS 16 'Leases'.
As a result, the Group also uses Adjusted profit before tax as a measure of performance, which is stated after add back of costs related to restructuring, acquisitions, share based payments, impairments and amortisation of acquired intangibles, but which is after the deduction of costs associated with property leases.

*£0.3 million of the equity settled share based payments is a non-cash charge related to the director's LTIP, which can only be redeemed in accordance with the terms outlined in the Directors' Remuneration Report.
Financial Position
Brave Bison ended the period with cash resources of £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million) and net cash after deducting outstanding bank loans of £6.2 million (2021: £4.7 million). The bank loan relates to a Government-backed CBIL that is repayable over six years from drawdown.
In addition to the CBIL, Brave Bison has a revolving credit facility with Barclays Bank for a total of £3 million, with an interest margin of 2.75% over Base Rate. This was agreed during the period but was undrawn at the period end.
The Group had cash inflow of £0.6 million during the period (2021: £3.2 million inflow), and expects to maintain positive cashflow throughout 2023. The decrease in cash inflow is largely due to a large customer prepayment received at the end of 2021, which subsequently unwound during the period.

"Who is Telegram for? Telegram is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls. Business users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options. Since Telegram groups can have up to 200,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient. You can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace. Public groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback. In case you're more into pictures, Telegram has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here). What's more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. With Telegram's cloud support and cache management options, Telegram can take up nearly zero space on your phone. Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy. And if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode."
"Do you process take-down requests from third parties? Our mission is to provide a secure means of communication that works everywhere on the planet. To do this in the places where it is most needed (and to continue distributing Telegram through the App Store and Google Play), we have to process legitimate requests to take down illegal public content (e.g., sticker sets, bots, groups and channels) within the app. For example, we can take down sticker sets that violate intellectual property rights or porn bots. Public content on Telegram, such as user-uploaded stickers sets, channels, and bots by third-party developers, is not part of the core Telegram UI. Whenever we receive a report regarding potentially illegal public content, we perform the necessary legal checks and take it down when deemed appropriate. Please note that this does not apply to local restrictions on freedom of speech. For example, if criticizing the government is illegal in some country, Telegram won't be a part of such politically motivated censorship. This goes against our founders' principles. While we do block terrorist (e.g. ISIS-related) bots and channels, we will not block anybody who peacefully expresses alternative opinions."

4.12. Taxation:
Tax expenses recognised in profit or loss comprise the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax not recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the statement of comprehensive income because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group's liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and are accounted for using the liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences, and deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be recognised.
Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

Year in Review:
2022 was a strong year for Brave Bison. During the period revenue grew by 46% to almost £32m, gross profit more than doubled to just under £17m and the company generated adjusted EBITDA of over £3m, a YoY increase of 71%. At year end our balance sheet remained strong with net cash of over £6m, after having completed our third acquisition since Theo, Philippa and I joined the company mid 2020.
""We operate from trend to spend for our customers""
During the period the Leadership Team maintained a sharp operational focus. We completed the integration of four businesses, made our third acquisition, and relaunched an enhanced value and service proposition under a refreshed Brave Bison brand. This integrated and connected approach has already proven its ability to attract new customers and allow for effective cross selling across our four business units.
Best Response Media (BRM) was acquired during the period and integrated into Brave Bison Commerce. Until the acquisition, our efforts at Brave Bison Commerce were focused on three major enterprise ecommerce platforms: SAP, Salesforce and BigCommerce. Through the acquisition of BRM, we are now able to offer services on Adobe Commerce Cloud, a ubiquitous platform that has grown from strength-to-strength in recent years. Furthermore, we acquired a highly experienced and flexible resource base in Mansoura, Egypt, as well as Tier 1 customers including NatWest.
Brave Bison is headquartered in London, but the business operates across the world. We have staff in 11 countries and almost a quarter of our team works remotely. Furthermore, over 50% of our staff work on a hybrid basis, often choosing to come into the office between one and three days per week. This new way of working is an important part of our strategy moving forward and is telling of the digital age we are leaning into as a business. Our hybrid and remote workforce enables us to hire more quickly, cheaply and often from a more diverse pool of talent. This approach also means that, as we scale and grow our teams, we can keep property costs low whilst maintaining a strong culture through a mixture of virtual team events and quarterly in person socials.
Theo and I are committed to developing Brave Bison's board in a thoughtful and measured way, in line with modern standards of governance. The appointment of Gordon Brough as non-executive director during the period is a further indication of this commitment. Gordon has extensive experience in UK public companies having been General Counsel at Aberdeen Asset Management plc (subsequently the asset management arm of Abrdn) for almost 10 years. Gordon's legal experience, as well as his expertise in acquisitions will be crucial to the business as we look to further bolster our corporate profile.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022
7.  Corporation Tax, continued
c) Deferred tax, continued
A deferred tax liability provision of £1,671,086 has been released during the year (2021: £332,532) on the future
tax payable on profits, on disposal of investments.
The Company has not recognised a deferred tax asset due to the inherent uncertainty that future investment gains
will offset such a tax asset.
In May 2021, the UK Government enacted a budget that increased the corporation tax rate to 25% from the current
rate of 19%. The deferred tax liabilities in these accounts have been adjusted to reflect these enacted tax rates.
8.  Earnings Per Share
The basic earnings per share is derived by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders by
the weighted average number of shares in issue.

Short term loans to related parties
-  At 30 September 2022 loans to Equity Resources Ltd (“EQR”), an associate of the company, totalling
£20,000 (2021: £20,000) remain unpaid. The purpose of the loans was to assist EQR meet its necessary
operational costs during a period when it seemed inappropriate that EQR should realise cash from its
investments. The advances were made prior to appointment of the current board and approved by former
directors at 0% interest with no formal agreement as to repayment date. The Company holds 28.41% of
the equity in EQR. The Company has made a full provision for these loans, totalling £20,000.

"? **Что такое бакалавриат?**
	До 2003 года выбора, как такового, у студентов не было — все учились пять лет и получали диплом специалиста. Когда Россия присоединилась к международной Болонской системе, студенты смогли получать высшее образование по ускоренной программе. Она включает в себя базовые знания по направлению обучения, которое обычно длится четыре года. Если студент стремится поднять уровень своих знаний, ему придётся ещё на два года поступить в магистратуру — главное, чтобы таковая была в выбранном вузе. Но можно продолжить обучение и в другом учебном заведении. У будущих бакалавров гораздо больший выбор в плане направлений — 187, зачётных единиц на треть меньше — около 240. Главный плюс бакалавриата — возможность устроиться на работу и в России, и за рубежом. Иностранные работодатели охотно принимают не связанных с конкретной специальностью выпускников-бакалавров, поскольку Болонская система образования имеет широкое распространение в США и Европе. Найти работу по специальности за границей несколько сложнее — аналогов специалитета в той же Европе нет. Бакалавры могут поступить в магистратуру, в том числе на бюджет. При этом им предоставляют отсрочку от армии."

"No.

How are you going to make money out of this? We believe in fast and secure messaging that is also 100% free. Our founder and CEO Pavel Durov, who financed Telegram throughout most of its history, has outlined a strategy to make Telegram sustainable in this post. Following this plan, Telegram has implemented sustainable forms of monetization that prioritize its users: In 2021, Telegram launched Sponsored Messages – minimalist, privacy-conscious advertisements that can appear in certain public channels. In 2022, Telegram launched a Premium subscription which users can purchase to both support the app and unlock additional exclusive features. These revenue streams help us pay for infrastructure costs and developer salaries, however making profits will never be an end-goal for Telegram."
"What if I’m more paranoid than your regular user? We've got you covered. Telegram’s special secret chats use end-to-end encryption, leave no trace on our servers, support self-destructing messages and don’t allow forwarding. On top of this, secret chats are not part of the Telegram cloud and can only be accessed on their devices of origin."

Directors’ report, continued
Management incentives
The Company has no share purchase, share option or other management incentive scheme.
As required by legislation, the Company has introduced a stakeholders' pension plan for the benefit of any future
employees.
Going concern
The Company finances its day-to-day activities from its available cash resources and, on occasion, by part
disposal of investments and the use of short-term loans.
The Directors are confident that adequate funding can be raised as required to meet the Company's current and
future liabilities, which has been confirmed within the cash flow forecast prepared by the Board for the 12 months
ending 28 February 2024. In the very unlikely event that suitable funding could not be raised, the Directors could
raise sufficient funds by disposal of certain of its current asset trade investments. Post-COVID-19 global
economics has had an impact on the company’s investments and their activities, however all investments held by
the company are Level 1 investments and hence the value at the balance sheet date approximates the fair value
which can be liquidated in order to settle the company’s liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future.
As at 30 September 2022, the Company has no Borrowings.
For the reasons outlined above, the Directors are satisfied that the Company will be able to meet its current and
future liabilities and continue trading for the foreseeable future and, in any event, for a period of not less than
twelve months from the date of approving the financial statements. Therefore, the Company has prepared its
financial statements on a going concern basis.
Management of capital
The Company's objectives when managing capital are:
-  to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern, so that it can continue to provide returns
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and
-  to provide an adequate return to shareholders by trading its current asset investments.
The Company sets the level of capital in proportion to risk. The Company manages the capital structure and makes
adjustments to it in the light of changes in economic conditions and the risk characteristics of the underlying assets.
Control procedures
The Board has approved financial budgets and cash forecasts; in addition, it has implemented procedures to
ensure compliance with applicable accounting standards and effective reporting.
Financial instruments
The Company uses financial instruments, comprising cash, trade investments and trade creditors, which arise
directly from its operations. The main purpose of these instruments is to further the company’s operations.
Short-term debtors and creditors
Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures.
Trade investments
Trade investments are stated at market/fair value less any provision for impairment. The movements between fair
and book value are set out in Note 10. The Board meets quarterly to consider investment strategy in respect of
the Company’s portfolio.
Interest rate risk
The Company finances its operations through retained profits and new investment funds raised. The Board utilises
short term floating rate interest bearing accounts to ensure adequate working capital is available whilst maximising
returns on deposits.

GOVERNANCE:
The Board believes that governance is central to the effective delivery of our mission and strategy. With this in mind, the Board is committed to ensuring that all decision-making and the oversight it provides promotes success for the long-term benefit of its shareholders, while being respectful of the interests of other key stakeholders. This includes our partners, customers and employees.
The Board has a strong balance of industry knowledge and financial experience. We have established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated duties and responsibilities and with written terms of reference. From time to time, separate committees may be set up by the Board to consider specific issues when the need arises.

4.4. Foreign currency translation:
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.

The assets and liabilities in the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and related goodwill are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Income and expenses are translated at the actual rate on the date of transaction. The exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiaries and on income and expenses during the year are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the ""translation reserve"" in equity.

Portfolio review, continued
Oracle Power plc, continued
In addition, it signed a Letter of Intent with TUV SUD to explore green hydrogen and green ammonia certification
and leased a land package of 7,000 acres for 30 years in the Thatta district to locate its flagship green hydrogen
project.
Kefi Gold and Copper plc (www.kefi-minerals.com)
Kefi Minerals is an exploration and development company focused on gold and copper deposits in the Arabian-
Nubian Shield. Its main projects are Tulu Kapi in Ethiopia and the Jibal Qutmanand Hawiah projects in Saudi
Arabia.
Operation on the Tula Kapi Mine in Ethiopia continued throughout the year. The Ministry of Mines completed an
audit and endorsed historical project costs incurred through 2020 of circa US$80m which will now be reported to
the Ethiopian central bank and allow for development banks to provide funds once the Ethiopian government
ratifies this report.
While awaiting regulatory permissions to re-activate exploration for near-mine expansion in Ethiopia, the company
has switched its main exploration efforts to Saudi Arabia. The Hawiah VMS Copper-Gold project has a JORC
resource of 24.9Mt at 0.9% Cu and 0.62g/t Au. A preliminary feasibility study is due for completion by the end of
2022. Jibal Qutman was enlarged this year with a +500,000oz production plan over ten years with an open
pit/carbon-in-leach process. A mining licence and financing is being sought for the project. The company received
additional exploration licences to bring its total to nine licences covering over 630km2.
Significant activities since year end: The Jibal Qutman licence has been renewed for a five-year term. The
company intends to construct a pioneers camp and carry out environmental baseline studies and geotechnical
and metallurgical diamond drilling going forward. The feasibility study remains on target for completion in early Q1
2023 with environmental permits targeted for Q1 2023 also. In January 2023 the company announced an increase
in resources at the Hawiah project by 16% to 29mt as well as an expanded open pit domain to the project.
Sunrise Resources plc (www.sunriseresourcesplc.com)
Sunrise Resources hold ground in Nevada (USA) and Australia with commodities including precious and base
metals as well as industrial minerals. Its main focus is developing pozzolan-perlite deposits while looking to enter
into a JV or sell its other tenements.
Sunrise continued with development of its pozzolan-perlite project with discussions with companies in the cement
and concrete industries. As natural pozzolan has a key role in cement decarbonisation strategies towards net-
zero CO2 emissions, it may benefit from California state legislation and Implementation Priorities under the Biden
administration’s $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill.
The company also extended its pozzolan footprint to a new project site at Hazen with due diligence field visits
carried out by interested parties and sample testing underway. A permit was obtained during the year to extract
500 tons of sample material for commercial trials.
A new Mining Lease application was submitted on the company’s Bakers Gold project in Western Australia to
cover high-grade gold mineralisation intersected in a 2021 drill programme, with a highlight of 2m at 14.36g/t Au
from 64m downhole. The project is available for sale or JV according to the company’s website.
Significant activities since year end: Sunrise announced it has entered into a collaborative arrangement with an
existing pozzolan processor for mining and test grinding. It also announced funding of £480,000 through issue of
equity with an investment from Towards Net Zero a US based institutional investor focused on the green economy.

2.1. Going Concern:
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that the Group will be able to meet its liabilities as they fall due for the foreseeable future, and at least for 12 months from the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements. The Group is dependent for its working capital requirements on cash generated from operations, and cash holdings. The cash holdings of the Group at 31 December 2022 were £6.5 million (2021: £5.9 million). The Group made a profit before tax of £1.5 million for the year ended 31 December 2022 (2021: £0.5 million), and generated an increase in cash and cash equivalents in 2022 of £0.6 million (2021: £3.2 million). The Group has net assets of £10.0 million (2021: £7.5 million).
The Directors have prepared detailed cash flow projections for the period to 31 December 2023 and for the following 6 month period to 30 June 2024 which are based on their current expectations of trading prospects. The Group achieved positive cashflow of £1.1 million in H2 2022, and the Board forecasts that the Group will continue to achieve positive cash inflows in 2023.
The Directors are confident that the Group's cash flow projections are achievable, and are committed to taking any actions available to them to ensure that any shortfall in forecast revenue receipts is mitigated by cost savings.
The Directors continue to maintain rolling forecasts which are regularly updated.
The Directors remain confident that the Group has sufficient cash resources for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements and accordingly, the Directors have concluded that it is appropriate to continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing these consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements consolidate the financial statements of Brave Bison Group plc and all its subsidiary undertakings up to 31 December 2022, with comparative information presented for the year ended 31 December 2021. No profit and loss account is presented for Brave Bison Group plc as permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to control the financial and operating policies and is exposed to or has rights over variable returns from its involvements with the investee and has the power to affect returns. Brave Bison Group plc obtains and exercises control through more than half of the voting rights for all its subsidiaries. All subsidiaries have a reporting date of 31 December and are consolidated from the acquisition date, which is the date from which control passes to Brave Bison Group plc.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF STARVEST PLC, continued
-  We determined the principal laws and regulations relevant to the company in this regard to be those arising
from:
-  Companies Act 2006
-  FRS 102
-  AIM Rules
-  We designed our audit procedures to ensure the audit team considered whether there were any indica-
tions of non-compliance by the company with those laws and regulations. These procedures included, but
were not limited to:
-  Enquiries of management
-  Review of board minutes and other correspondence
-  Review of the company’s related party transactions and disclosures
-  We also identified the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements due to fraud. We consid-
ered, in addition to the non-rebuttable presumption of a risk of fraud arising from management override of
controls, that the existence and good title to investments represented the greatest risk of fraud.
-  We addressed the risk of fraud arising from management override of controls by performing audit proce-
dures which included, but were not limited to: the testing of journals and evaluating the business rationale
of any significant transactions that are unusual or outside the normal course of business.
Because of the inherent limitations of an audit, there is a risk that we will not detect all irregularities, including
those leading to a material misstatement in the financial statements or non-compliance with regulation.  This risk
increases the more that compliance with a law or regulation is removed from the events and transactions reflected
in the financial statements, as we will be less likely to become aware of instances of non-compliance. The risk is
also greater regarding irregularities occurring due to fraud rather than error, as fraud involves intentional
concealment, forgery, collusion, omission or misrepresentation.
A further description of our responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements is located on the Financial
Reporting Council’s website at: www.frc.org.uk/auditorsresponsibilities. This description forms part of our auditor’s
report.
Use of our report
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone, other than the company and the company's
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.

Investing policy statement:
About us
The previous Board commenced to manage the Company as an investment company in January 2002, largely
investing in the natural resources sector. Following the appointment of Callum Baxter as Chairman in 2015, the
Board continued to focus the Company’s investment strategy on the natural resources sector.
Collectively, the current Board has significant experience investing in small-capitalisation new issues and pre-IPO
opportunities in the natural resources and mineral exploration sectors.
Company objective
The Company was established as a source of early-stage finance to fledgling businesses to maximise the capital
value of the Company and to generate benefits for Shareholders in the form of capital growth and modest
dividends.
Investing strategy
Natural resources:  Whilst the Company’s investment mandate is not exclusively limited to natural resources, the
Board sees this sector as having considerable growth potential in the medium term. Historically, investments were
generally made immediately prior to an initial public offering on AIM or AQSE as well as in the aftermarket.  As the
nature of the public equity markets has changed since 2008, it is more likely that the future investment portfolio
will include companies that have completed an IPO but remain in the early stages of identifying or, with the
appropriate financial backing, developing a commercial resource.
Direct Projects: The Company’s strategy is to invest predominantly through ownership of equity stakes in target
companies. However, the Company believes there may be opportunities to take direct interests in mining projects
and subsequently to acquire equity positions in target companies on favourable terms in exchange for these direct
project interests. Those companies would therefore become Starvest investee companies. The projects will be
operated by the investee company; Starvest does not intend to manage any projects. The addition of the Direct
Project strategy to the Company’s Investing Policy was approved by shareholders at the Company’s annual
general meeting held 1 December 2017.
Investment size:  Initial investments are usually not greater than £100,000. Target companies invariably have an
ongoing need for additional funding to continue exploration and development. Therefore, after appropriate due
diligence, the Company may provide further funding support and make later market purchases, so that the total
investment may exceed £100,000.
High risk:  The business is inherently high risk and cyclical, dependent upon fluctuations in world economic activity
which affects the demand for minerals. However, the Company affords investors the opportunity to participate in
diverse early-stage ventures, which the Board believes will offer the potential for significant returns for the
foreseeable future.
Lack of liquidity:  Shares of investee companies typically trade in small volumes, even if they are quoted on AIM,
AQSE, ASX, or TSX-V. Therefore, during the early phase following an investment, it is rarely possible to liquidate
a position at the quoted market price so investors must remain patient until the investee company develops and
ultimately attracts greater market interest. If and when an exploration company finds a large exploitable resource,
it typically presents greater liquidity to patient investors as an acquisition target by a third party or as a much larger
and more actively traded independent entity.
Success rate:  Of the multiple investments held at any one time, it is expected that no more than five will prove
to be ‘winners’; from half of the remainder we may expect to see modest share price improvements. Overall, we
expect that over time portfolio returns will be acceptable if not substantial. Accordingly, the Board is unable to give
any estimate of the magnitude or timing of returns.
Profit distribution:  When profits have been realised, and adequate cash is available, the Board intends to
distribute up to half the profits realised.

Corporate governance statement, continued
All Directors have access to the advice of the Company’s solicitors and the Company Secretary; necessary
information is supplied to the Directors on a timely basis to enable them to discharge their duties effectively and
all Directors have access to independent professional advice, at the Company’s expense, as and when required.
Callum Baxter’s active background in the mining industry (exploration geology) for more than 25 years and taking
companies through the IPO process, as well as personal experience in investing in the natural resource sector,
allows for an in-depth knowledge of the challenges potential investee companies face when progressing a
company towards expansion and/or public listing. Callum also has a wide range of connections in the natural
resource sector and supporting companies (e.g. brokering firms, NOMADs, corporate finance) from which to draw
information on potential investments. His skill set allows seasoned evaluation of the investment opportunities
presented to the Company before an informed decision is made. Callum regularly attends conferences and
meetings to keep fully abreast of the sector.
Mark Badros has extensive experience in investment in public and private equities and corporate law, as well as
a background in economics and business, including securities, mergers and acquisitions. Gemma Cryan’s
background in oil and gas and mineral exploration, both in the field and office environment, in numerous countries,
allows her to draw on personal experience and professional connections for information on potential investments
as well as the ability to review projects from a geological and corporate perspective with regards to risk
management. Her administrative and interpersonal skills are applied to corporate matters and seeking investment
opportunities. Gemma regularly attends sector meetings and conferences and participates in courses on both
technical and corporate matters.
The Directors remain active in their relevant sectors allowing them to keep their skills up to date. These activities
are strengthened by Directors’ regular attendance at relevant industry conferences and workshops throughout the
year assisting Directors to keep their skills aligned to current industry standards.
All Directors, jointly or independently, have access to the Company’s solicitor for external advice should they so
choose. The Company Secretary role is managed by the Company’s solicitor. Issues of compliance to government
or government body regulations and requirements are brought to the Boards attention as necessary and advice is
provided on methods required to comply fully. Matters arising with service contracts or agreements and general
Company administration are also referred to the Company’s solicitor and secretary for review and/or comment.
The Company’s Non-Executive Director for the period to 31st August 2022 is considered an Independent
Director. Mr. Badros has no ties to the major shareholders of the Company nor any significant personal investment
in the Company or in its investee companies, except as disclosed; as such the Board considers his input, advice
and support on the running of the Company and investment opportunities that arise as independent. Mr Baxter
took the role of Non-executive Chairman 1st September 2022 and is not considered independent.
7: Evaluate board performance based on clear and relevant objectives seeking continuous improvement.
The Board evaluates its performance effectiveness based on reviews carried out at every board meeting where a
critical review is carried out and performance objectives are benchmarked against current market dynamics.
During the year these critical reviews showed the Company had made positive progress and results were
presented to shareholders at the most recent AGM.
The Company does not currently have a formal evaluation procedure for individual board members. Board
members are able to communicate effectively, and members are actively encouraged to participate in continuing
professional development (CPD). The Directors remain active in their relevant sectors allowing them to keep their
skills  up  to  date.  These  activities  are  strengthened  by  Directors’  regular  attendance  at  relevant  industry
conferences and workshops throughout the year assisting Directors to keep their skills aligned to current industry
standards.

Financial risk management
The Group's financial instruments comprise cash and liquid resources and various items, such as trade receivables and trade payables that arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group's operations. The principal financial risks faced by the Group are liquidity, foreign currency and credit risks. The policies and strategies for managing these risks are summarised as follows:
Foreign currency risk
Transactional foreign currency exposures arise from both the export of services from the UK to overseas clients, and from the import of services directly sourced from overseas suppliers. The Group is primarily exposed to foreign exchange in relation to movements in sterling against the US Dollar, the Euro and the Singapore Dollar.
The Group does not use derivatives to hedge translation exposures. All gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss on translation at the reporting date. The Group's current exposures in respect of currency risk are as follows:
: Financial assets, Sterling £000's: 9,297, US Dollar £000's: 2,606, Singapore Dollar £000's: 22, Euro £000's: 266, Other £000's: -, Total £000's: 12,191
: Financial liabilities, Sterling £000's: (8,095), US Dollar £000's: (2,347), Singapore Dollar £000's: (178), Euro £000's: (141), Other £000's: (72), Total £000's: (10,833)
: Total exposure at 31 December 2021, Sterling £000's: 1,202, US Dollar £000's: 259, Singapore Dollar £000's: (156), Euro £000's: 125, Other £000's: (72), Total £000's: 1,358
: Financial assets, Sterling £000's: 11,106, US Dollar £000's: 888, Singapore Dollar £000's: 19, Euro £000's: 600, Other £000's: 40, Total £000's: 12,653
: Financial liabilities, Sterling £000's: (6,654), US Dollar £000's: (1,595), Singapore Dollar £000's: (59), Euro £000's: (52), Other £000's: (100), Total £000's: (8,460)
: Total exposure at 31 December 2022, Sterling £000's: 4,452, US Dollar £000's: (707), Singapore Dollar £000's: (40), Euro £000's: 548, Other £000's: (60), Total £000's: 4,193
Sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates the estimated impact on profit or loss as a result of market movements in the US Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Euro and Sterling exchange rate.
Impact on loss and equity:
: For the year to 31 December 2021, 10% Increase US Dollars £000's: (26), 10% Decrease US Dollars £000's: 26, 10% Increase Singapore Dollars £000's: 16, 10% Decrease Singapore Dollars £000's: (16), 10% Increase Euro £000's: (13), 10% Decrease Euro £000's: 13
: For the year to 31 December 2022, 10% Increase US Dollars £000's: 71, 10% Decrease US Dollars £000's: (71), 10% Increase Singapore Dollars £000's: 4, 10% Decrease Singapore Dollars £000's: (4), 10% Increase Euro £000's: (55), 10% Decrease Euro £000's: 55
Credit risk
The Group's principal financial assets are cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk and manages this by running quarterly credit checks and setting appropriate credit limits. The maximum exposure to credit risk is that shown within the balance sheet. Management has assessed the exposure to credit risk and has provided against any items which is considered to be high risk.
Liquidity/funding risk
The Group's funding strategy is to ensure a mix of funding sources offering flexibility and cost effectiveness to match the requirements of the Group.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds the majority of its cash and cash equivalents in corporate current accounts and interest bearing money market accounts. These accounts offer a competitive interest rate with the advantage of quick access to the funds. The Group is in a net cash positive position and management consider there to be a low level of risk.
Capital policy
The Group's objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group's ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure that optimises the cost of capital.
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the Group consists of cash and cash equivalents as disclosed in the statement of financial position and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in the consolidated statement of changes in equity.
Financial instruments measured at fair value
Financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value in the statement of financial position are grouped into three levels of fair value hierarchy. This grouping is determined based on the lowest level of significant inputs used in fair value measurement, as follows:
• level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
• level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
• level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The Group categorises all financial assets and liabilities as level 1.
Maturity analysis
Set out below is a maturity analysis for non-derivative financial liabilities. The amounts disclosed are based on contractual undiscounted cash flows. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. The Group had no derivative financial liabilities at either reporting date.

Unutilised tax losses carried forward which have not been recognised as a deferred tax asset at 31 December 2022 were £49.9 million (2021: £52.4 million). These have not been recognised due to uncertainty about future consistent taxable profits. Deferred tax has been calculated at a rate of 25% given the change in rate which has been substantively enacted at the statement of financial position date.

: , 2022 £000's: 7,426, 2021 £000's: 6,636
The contractual value of trade receivables is £5.6 million (2021: £4.3 million). Their carrying value is assessed to be £5.0 million (2021: £3.7 million) after assessing recoverability. The contractual value and the carrying value of other receivables are considered to be the same. The Group's management considers that all financial assets that are not impaired or past due are of good credit quality.
The ageing analysis of these trade receivables showing fully performing and past due but not impaired is as follows:
: Not overdue, 2022 £000's: 3,357, 2021 £000's: 1,814

: , 2022 £000's: 5,026, 2021 £000's: 3,699
The movement in provision for impairment of trade receivables can be reconciled as follows:
: Opening provision, 2022 £000's: (559), 2021 £000's: (40)
: Provisions from acquisition of Greenlight, 2022 £000's: -, 2021 £000's: (500)
: Provisions from acquisition of Best Response Media, 2022 £000's: (70), 2021 £000's: -

: , 2022 £000's: 9,310, 2021 £000's: 10,528
All amounts are short term and the Directors consider that the carrying value of trade and other payables are considered to be a reasonable approximation of fair value.
The average credit period taken for trade purchases was 34 days (2021: 53 days).
Contract liabilities are utilised upon satisfaction of the associated contract performance obligations. The 2022 contract liability of £1.9 million is expected to be utilised in the next reporting periods upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligation. The 2021 contract liability of £1.3 million was recognised within revenue during 2022 upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligation.
19 Lease Liabilities
Lease liabilities are presented in the statement of financial position as follows:
: Current, 2022 £000's: 393, 2021 £000's: 629

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2022
3.  Principal Accounting Policies, continued
Taxation, continued
Historically, the Company’s previous board had filed as a trading company and described its investment portfolio
as  a  current  asset. Following  a  comprehensive  review  of various  factors  related  to  the  Company’s
investment portfolio and strategy, including, among others, the frequency, timing, liquidity, trading activities,
development stage and investment horizon of such investments individually and the portfolio as a whole, the
Company’s  current  board  have  determined  the  Company  is  appropriately  classified as  an  investment
company, and the investment portfolio is properly accounted for among the Company’s fixed assets. The Board
do not consider this to be a change in accounting policy; rather, it is a correction in presentation to reflect more
accurately the factual position.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided on an undiscounted full provision basis on all timing differences which have arisen but
not reversed at the balance sheet date using rates of tax enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet
date.
Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that they will be recovered against the
reversal of deferred tax liabilities or other future taxable profits and are recognised within debtors. The deferred
tax assets and liabilities all relate to the same legal entity and being due to or from the same tax authority are
offset on the balance sheet.
FRS 102 requires that investments are valued each year on the mark-to-market basis and the revaluation
differences are reflected in the profit and loss account. However, the tax on any unrealised profit is calculated and
shown in the accounts as if the profit had been realised, but there is then an adjustment in the deferred tax to
move the tax that relates to the unrealised profit to the balance sheet.
Foreign Currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency are translated into the functional currency at the
exchange rate ruling at the reporting date, unless specifically covered by foreign exchange contracts whereupon
the contract rate is used.
Investments
Current investments are stated at mid-market publicly quoted prices.
Investments in unlisted company shares are remeasured to available market values, or Directors’ valuations at
each balance sheet date.  Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income for the period. As at 30 September 2022 unlisted shares were valued at £nil (2021: £nil).
Investments in listed company shares are remeasured to market value at each balance sheet date under level 1
of the fair value hierachy. Gains and losses on remeasurement are recognised in the statement of comprehensive
income for the period.
Dividend income is recognised in the income statement when the right to receive payment is established from
investee companies.
Financial instruments:
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are not interest bearing and are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less provision for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and deposits held at call with banks.
